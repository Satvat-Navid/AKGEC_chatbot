Problem Statement: The lack of pre-booking facility of government-approved guides at various monuments of Rajasthan. Solution Proposed: We planned to make a web portal through which tourists can book government-approved guides for any historic monument of Rajasthan in advance. This will help the tourists in saving time and efforts in searching for the guide and in turn, will generate employment in the tourism sector. Our solution will help the Ministry of Tourism in keeping track of various activities like helping the tourists (National / International) by getting a Govt. licensed tour guide booked in real time with minimal efforts keeping a track of transaction records too. Participants: Team Name : AKG Rockers Team Leader : Shashwat Jain Team Member 1 : Shivam Jain Team Member 2 : Priyanka Sharma Team Member 3 : Vikas Yadav 2. Problem Statement: To provide a virtual tour of Rajasthan and experience its culture in its full glory by bringing the historic moments to life. Solution Proposed: We planned to make a VR web application through which anyone can have a virtual tour of Rajasthan and can experience its culture. This web application contains 360 degree images of all the tourist destinations, it also contains the current weather conditions of that place for those who want to go there.

Narendra Modi. Nearly 2,000 school and college students attended this live programme at Talkatora Stadium. Besides those present at the venue, about 10 crore students from across the country had also participated through video conferencing. Hon’ble Prime Minister started the interactive session on a lighter note that the students are going to take their examinations in few days from now but for him the test is today. He urged the students to always keep a student in them alive. The Prime Minister advised the students in many ways regarding how to remain stress free during examination time of the year. Emphasizing the importance of self-confidence, the Prime Minister said the students should consider themselves to be their own examiners. He recommended that the competition should not be with others but with ourselves. Focus should be on how to improve oneself. He also urged that parents should not make the achievements of their child a matter of social prestige as every child is blessed with unique talents. The session lasting about 2 hours 30 minutes, was highly interactive. In addition to the students present at the venue, many students also interacted through the MyGov.in portal and Narendra Modi app. He spoke about the importance of a healthy balance between IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and EQ (Emotional Quotient). He stressed that emotional bonding is essential for one’s overall development. It helps in forging relationships. Intelligence without an emotional connect is worthless. IQ might help to achieve success, but EQ gives purpose to life. Over all this visit was very beneficial and knowledgeable experience for our students. The students felt fortunate to be attending the session and enjoyed it at their best.

All they needed to do was message a technical article they like to the official page of Phoenix on Facebook and accordingly, their articles were posted. The top TWO articles with maximum likes got a point advantage. First Round This was a pen-paper cum visual round. A 20-marks question paper was set, that included 10 questions on logos of popular technical companies and 10 questions based on taglines of popular electronic brands, each question carried 1 mark. The second part of this round involved a video based on emerging technologies shown to the participants, such as 5G technology, Internet of Things, etc., followed by a couple of questions based on the same, each had a weight age of 5 marks. Based on the pre-round and the above stated round, 15 teams having the maximum marks in minimum time were shortlisted for the final round. This round helped the students exercise their brains in finding the appropriate and the most suitable article. This made them go through a variety of new technologies. The paper round tested and enhanced their knowledge about popular companies. Final Round The teams eligible for this round were given a riddle. The solution of the riddle gave the name of a place in the college, for example BB Shed, Canteen, etc. The teams needed to solve the riddle and get to the place. Once they reached the given spot, they were given a sealed envelope. They brought it back to the starting point, without tampering the seal. The catch was such that three teams were supposed to reach one spot, the team reaching first progressed. So, this was a race against time as well as other teams. Once the team reached the starting point, the seal of the envelope was opened. There was another riddle that gave the name of a famous scientist. The team doing both the jobs, bringing back the envelope and deciphering the name of the scientist, in the minimum amount of time secured maximum points.

Inaugural Ceremony of Innovation Lab AKGEC seeks to foster a culture of innovation among engineering students by their contribution in developing projects/application for Industrial/Social benefits. To meet this objective, AKGEC with support of National Instruments has launched a concept of i-lab (Innovation Lab) under LabVIEW Academy. The inaugural ceremony of i-lab held on 5th Feb, 2015, 11:00 AM at main seminar hall. Mr. Solikutty Dhanabal, Academic Program Manager, National Instruments, Bangalore was the Chief Guest for the ceremony. First of its kind in India, the i- lab aims to break the space and time barriers between classroom and laboratories. Innovation Lab offers hands on experiential engineering for innovative thinkers to develop new products/applications using LabVIEW platform through powerful portable data acquisition systems of NI using concept of ANYWHERE/ ANYTIME Engineering. For AKGEC students and teams wanting to test and refine their ideas and ventures, Innovation lab includes a number of resources that place students in a less structured environment in order to ‘learn by doing’. The Innovation Lab (i-lab) is to serve as a resource for students from across AKGEC interested in entrepreneurship and innovation. The portable innovation kit, consisting of ‘state of the art’ NI MyDAQ/ MyRio platforms along with required hardware including sensors/actuators, USB Cables, drivers, motor, potentiometer, Switches, LED, Multimeters, connecting wires, Diodes, IC’s and software facilities, will help the students to conceptualize their ideas into reality. Trained students and CLAD Certified Professional are initially eligible to get this magic kit issued and for 10 days period. Student may get this kit re-issued for longer duration, after submitting their concrete plan/proposal for the development of any new and innovative idea. On this occasion, AKGEC has signed an MOU with M/s Electrono Solutions Pvt Ltd, Bangalore to support i-lab initiative and nurture innovative activities under LabVIEW Academy. The main objective of this association is to promote students’ interest towards innovation and entrepreneurship. Empty tab. Edit page to add content here. Empty tab. Edit page to add content here.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_International,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Professional association and standards organization for transport and other industries This article is about SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers). For other organizations named SAE, see SAE . SAE International Company type Professional organization Industry Automotive , automobile , aerospace , commercial vehicle Founded 1905 ; 120 years ago ( 1905 ) Headquarters Warrendale, Pennsylvania Number of locations 7 Area served Worldwide Key people Andrew L. Riker Henry Ford Thomas Edison Glenn Martin Orville Wright Charles Kettering Products Industry standards, membership, conferences, publications, professional development Members 138,000 Website www .sae .org SAE International is a global professional association and standards organization based in Warrendale , Pennsylvania , United States . Formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers , the organization adopted its current name in 2006 to reflect both its international membership and the increased scope of its activities beyond automotive engineering and the automotive industry to include aerospace and other transport industries, as well as commercial vehicles including autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars , trucks , surface vessels , drones , and related technologies. SAE International has over 138,000 global members. Membership is granted to individuals, rather than companies. Aside from its standardization efforts, SAE International also devotes resources to projects and programs in STEM education, professional certification , and collegiate design competitions. History [ edit ] In the early 1900s there were dozens of automobile manufacturers in the United States, and many more worldwide. Auto manufacturers and parts companies joined trade groups that promoted business. A desire to solve common technical design problems and develop engineering standards was emerging. Engineers in the automobile business expressed a desire to have ""free exchange of ideas"" to expand their technical knowledge base. Two magazine publishers, Peter Heldt of The Horseless Age , and Horace Swetland of The Automobile , were advocates of the concepts for SAE. Heldt wrote an editorial in June 1902 in which he said, ""Now there is a noticeable tendency for automobile manufacturers to follow certain accepted lines of construction, technical questions constantly arise which seek a solution from the cooperation of the technical men connected with the industry. These questions could best be dealt with by a technical society. The field of activity for this society would be the purely technical side of automobiles."" [ 1 ] Horace Swetland wrote on automotive engineering concerns and became an original SAE officer. About two years after Heldt's editorial, the Society of Automobile Engineers was founded in New York City. Four officers and five managing officers volunteered. In 1905 Andrew L. Riker [ 2 ] served as president, [ 3 ] and Henry Ford served as the society's first vice president. The initial membership was engineers with annual dues of US$10. Over the first 10 years, SAE membership grew steadily, and the society added full-time staff and began to publish a technical journal and a comprehensive compilation of technical papers, previously called SAE Transactions, which still exist today in the form of SAE International's Journals. By 1916 SAE had 1,800 members. At the annual meeting that year, representatives from the American Society of Aeronautic Engineers, the Society of Tractor Engineers, as well as representatives from the power boating industry made a pitch to SAE for oversight of technical standards in their industries. Aeronautics was a fledgling industry at that time. Early supporters of the concept of a society to represent aeronautical engineers were Thomas Edison , Glenn Curtiss , Glenn Martin , and Orville Wright . Survey results on the adoption rate of SAE standards among various manufacturers, reported in the journal Horseless Age , 1916 Out of the meeting in 1916 came a new organization, to represent engineers in all types of mobility-related professions. SAE member Elmer Sperry created the term ""automotive"" from Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion) origins to represent any form of self-powered vehicle. The Society of Automobile Engineers became the Society of Automotive Engineers. Women joined the SAE in the 1920's, with Marie Luhring becoming an associate member of the organization in 1920. [ 4 ] Ethel H. Bailey became the first woman to become a full member of the SAE in 1926, [ 5 ] having joined the staff as a research engineer in 1920. [ 6 ] Charles Kettering presided over SAE during World War I and saw membership pass the 5,000 mark. During this time, SAE emphasized the importance of developing member activity through local chapters – called Sections . After World War II , the Society established links with other standards bodies and automotive engineering societies worldwide, and since then has founded sections in countries including Brazil, India, China, Russia, Romania, and Egypt. By 1980, membership surpassed 35,000 and over the next two decades the society, like the industries and individuals it serves, became larger, more global, more diverse, and more electronic. By the mid-1980s, membership edged close to 50,000; by the end of the 1990s, membership topped 80,000 with members in more than 80 countries. [ 7 ] As of 2017, the society serves over 138,000 global members, [ 8 ] with more than a quarter from outside of North America.

[ 19 ] 2006 SAE officially changes its name from Society of Automotive Engineers to SAE International to better reflect its current scope: both the increasingly international scope of its activities and membership and the applicability to other industries besides the automotive industry , such as the aerospace industry . 2010s [ 7 ] 2010 SAE membership reaches 120,000. 2012 SAE International acquires Tech Briefs Media Group. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] 2014 SAE International Completes Asset Purchase of ARINC Industry Activities – Expands Aerospace Portfolio. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] 2019 SAE International forms Automated Vehicle Safety Consortium [ 24 ] Technical standards [ edit ] SAE International provides a forum for companies, government agencies, research institutions and consultants to devise technical standards and recommended practices for the design, construction, and characteristics of motor vehicle components. [ 8 ] [ 25 ] SAE documents do not carry any legal force, but are in some cases referenced by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Aerospace industry standards [ edit ] SAE publishes technical documents for the aerospace industry. [ 28 ] Aerospace Recommended Practices are recommendations for engineering practice, and Aerospace Information Reports contain general accepted engineering data and information. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Levels of autonomy [ edit ] Main article: Self-driving car § Classification SAE has proposed an influential categorization for ""levels of driving automation"" in vehicular automation. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] SAE J3016 defines six levels of automation for cars, ranging from level 0 (No Driving Automation) to level 5 (Full Automation), transitioning gradually from ""driver support features"" to ""automated driving features"". This categorization scheme has also been adopted by the NHTSA . [ 33 ] SAE units [ edit ] For historical legacy reasons, the label ""SAE"" is commonly used on tools and hardware in North America to indicate United States customary units measurements, that is, inch -based not metric (SI) . Both this usage and casual use of the term "" Imperial "" are loose and imprecise (but common) references to inch fractional sizes and to the screw thread sizes of the Unified Thread Standard (UTS). Horsepower ratings [ edit ] SAE has long provided standards for rating automobile horsepower . Until 1971–1972 SAE gross power was used. Similar to brake horsepower (bhp), it gave generously unrealistic performance ratings. Since then, the standard has been the more conservative SAE net power , which takes into account engine accessory, emissions, "
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_International,"ake horsepower (bhp), it gave generously unrealistic performance ratings. Since then, the standard has been the more conservative SAE net power , which takes into account engine accessory, emissions, and exhaust drags, but not transmission losses. Publications [ edit ] SAE International has been publishing technical information since 1906. Industry magazines published monthly include: Automotive Engineering International , Aerospace Engineering and Manufacturing , Off Highway Engineering , Truck & Bus Engineering , SAE Vehicle Engineering , e-newsletters, Momentum magazine for student members, and various journals. SAE also produces the monthly Update newsletter for its members and publishes more than 100 books a year in print and electronic formats. Ranging from compilations on various technical subjects, to textbooks, to historical and enthusiast-oriented books, SAE's titles cater to a variety of readers. In April 2007, MIT canceled its subscription to SAE because of required digital rights management (DRM) technology implemented on SAE web-based database of technical papers. [ 34 ] SAE International removed the DRM restrictions for colleges, universities, and other academic institutions. [ 35 ] [ better source needed ] SAE Foundation [ edit ] In 1986, SAE International established the SAE Foundation to support science and technology education. One of the most pressing issues facing industry today is the decline of students enrolling in science and technology programs. [ 36 ] This decline and its impact threaten the ability to meet future workforce demands. The SAE Foundation encourages and supports the development of skills related to mathematics, technology, engineering and science. [ 37 ] STEM program [ edit ] A World In Motion is a teacher-administered, industry volunteer-assisted program that brings science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education to life in the classroom for students in Kindergarten through Grade 12. [ 38 ] Benchmarked to the national standards, AWIM incorporates the laws of physics, motion, flight and electronics into age-appropriate hands on activities that reinforce classroom STEM curriculum. [ 39 ] SAE Collegiate Design Series [ edit ] The SAE Collegiate Design Series provides an opportunity for college students to go beyond textbook theory and replicates the process of engineering design and manufacturing. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] In the CDS program, a company wants to sell a product for a specific market segment, for example a radio controlled airplane, a single seat off-road vehicle, or a single seat Formula style race car. [ 42 ] Instead of doing all the design, manufacturing and testing in house, the customer chooses to contract out those processes to a supplier, and sends their requirements out for bid. Student teams act as the suppliers and design, build and test a prototype vehicle that they believe meets the customer's specifications. [ 42 ] Each team then presents its prototype to the customer at the annual competitions and is judged on several criteria. [ 42 ] The team with the highest points essentially wins the contract. The SAE Collegiate Design Series competitions include the following: SAE Aero Design – a series of competitive mechanical engineering events, it is generally divided into three categories: Regular class, Advanced class and Micro class.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Vehicle designed to transport persons or goods for compensation Trucks and vans , two types of vehicles common as commercial vehicles, operated by DR in Copenhagen , Denmark A commercial vehicle is any type of motor vehicle used for transporting goods or paying passengers. Depending on laws and designations, a commercial vehicle can be any broad type of motor vehicle used commercially or for business purposes. Classification [ edit ] In the United States, a vehicle is designated ""commercial"" when it is titled or registered to a company. This is a broad definition, as commercial vehicles may be fleet vehicles , company cars , or other vehicles used for business. Vehicles that are designed to carry more than 15 passengers are considered a commercial vehicle. Variations may exist from state-to-state on which ""commercial vehicles"" are prohibited on certain routes and lanes and between homeowner associations, which may employ broader definitions than their municipalities with regard to their own parking restrictions. [ 1 ] Broadly defined, a vehicle may be considered a commercial vehicle if it: Belongs to a company or corporation Is used for business, but is in an individual's name, such as a sole proprietor Is a leased vehicle and in the name of the financial institution that owns it Exceeds a certain weight or class and therefore, is ""classified"" as commercial even though it may not be commercially used or commercially owned; a weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more is always considered commercial [ 2 ] Is used to haul any hazardous material A vehicle can be used for a business, if not exclusively, and remain privately licensed, depending on the amount of time used for business. Legal definitions [ edit ] In the United States, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration defines a ""commercial motor vehicle"" as any self-propelled or towed vehicle used on a public highway in interstate commerce to transport passengers or property when the vehicle: [ 3 ] Has a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,536 kg (10,001 pounds) or more Is designed or used to transport more than 8 passengers (including the driver) for compensation; Is designed or used to transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver, not used to transport passengers for compensation; Is used in transporting material found by the Secretary of Transportation to be hazardous. The federal definition, though followed closely, is meant to accommodate and remain flexible to each state's definitions. The European Union defines a ""commercial motor vehicle"" as any motorized road vehicle, that by its type of construction and equipment is designed for, and capable of transporting, whether for payment or not: [ 4 ] More than nine persons, including the driver; Goods and ""standard fuel tanks"". This means the tanks permanently fixed by the manufacturer to all motor vehicles of the same type as the vehicle in question and whose permanent fitting lets fuel be used directly, both for propulsion and, where appropriate, to power a refrigeration system. Gas tanks fitted to motor vehicles for the direct use of diesel as a fuel are considered standard fuel tanks. Commercial truck classification [ edit ] Further information: Truck classification Commercial trucks are classified according to the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). Commercial vehicles are divided into eight classes based upon the gross vehicle weight (GVW). The United States Department of Transportation classifies commercial trucks with eight classes: [ 5 ] Class 1 – GVWR ranges from 0 to 6,000 pounds (0 to 2,722 kg) Class 2 – GVWR ranges from 6,001 to 10,000 pounds (2,722 to 4,536 kg) Class 3 – GVWR ranges from 10,001 to 14,000 pounds (4,536 to 6,350 kg) Class 4 – GVWR ranges from 14,001 to 16,000 pounds (6,351 to 7,257 kg) Class 5 – GVWR ranges from 16,001 to 19,500 pounds (7,258 to 8,845 kg) Class 6 – GVWR ranges from 19,501 to 26,000 pounds (8,846 to 11,793 kg) Class 7 – GVWR ranges from 26,001 to 33,000 pounds (11,794 to 14,969 kg) Class 8 – GVWR is anything above 33,000 pounds (14,969 kg) Examples of commercial vehicles [ edit ] Truck Box truck Farm truck Mini truck Pickup truck Semi-trailer truck Tow truck Van Light commercial vehicle Panel van Bus Coach Trailers Caravan over 10,000 pounds Heavy equipment (in mining equipment , construction equipment , farming machinery ) Taxi Share taxi Auto rickshaw Motorcycle taxi Commercial vehicles are sometimes sought after for historic preservation as classic cars . News about preservation can be found in magazines such as Hemmings Motor News and Heritage Commercials . Legal issues [ edit ] Commercial vehicle accidents and injuries are often more complex than regular car accidents, often involving additional concerns, background checks on operator driving records, and corporate maintenance records.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Organizations involved with motor vehicles An automotive assembly line at Opel Manufacturing Poland in 2015 SEAT , Škoda , and Volkswagen cars being transported by train in Kutná Hora , Czech Republic in 2014 The automotive industry comprises a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design , development , manufacturing , marketing , selling , repairing , and modification of motor vehicles . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is one of the world's largest industries by revenue (from 16% such as in France up to 40% in countries such as Slovakia). [ 3 ] [ failed verification ] The word automotive comes from the Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion ), referring to any form of self-powered vehicle. This term, as proposed by Elmer Sperry [ 4 ] [ need quotation to verify ] (1860–1930), first came into use to describe automobiles in 1898. [ 5 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of the automobile This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( January 2024 ) The Thomas B. Jeffery Company automobile factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin around 1916 Fiat 1800 and 2100 sedans being assembled at a Fiat factory in 1961 The automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers pioneering the horseless carriage . Early car manufacturing involved manual assembly by a human worker. The process evolved from engineers working on a stationary car to a conveyor belt system where the car passed through multiple stations of more specialized engineers. In the 1960s, robotic equipment was introduced, and most cars are now mainly assembled by automated machinery. [ 6 ] For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production, with the U.S. Big Three General Motors , Ford Motor Company , and Chrysler being the world's three largest auto manufacturers for a time, and G.M. and Ford remaining the two largest until the mid-2000s. In 1929, before the Great Depression , the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, of which the U.S. automobile enterprises produced more than 90%. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. [ 7 ] After 1945, the U.S. produced around three-quarters of the world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became a world leader again in 1994. Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production during 2006 and 2007, and in 2008 also China , which in 2009 took the top spot (from Japan) with 13.8 million units, although the U.S. surpassed Japan in 2011, to become the second-largest automobile industry. In 2023, China had more than 30 million produced vehicles a year for the first time in history, after reaching 29 million for the first time in 2017 and 28 million the year before. From 1970 (140 models) to 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially. [ 8 ] Safety [ edit ] Main article: Automobile safety See also: 2009–2011 Toyota vehicle recalls , General Motors ignition switch recalls , and Firestone and Ford tire controversy A 2010 Hyundai Tucson used for a crash test by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Safety is a state that implies being protected from any risk, danger, damage, or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators, or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves implies that there is no risk of damage. Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262 , is considered one of the best practice frameworks for achieving automotive functional safety . [ 9 ] In case of safety issues, danger, product defect , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall . Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from raw materials. Product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences. Economy [ edit ] See also: Automotive industry by country An advertisement for the Pontiac 6 , c. 1928 In 2007, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road, consuming over 980 billion litres (980,000,000 m 3 ) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. [ 12 ] The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicted that, by 2014, one-third of world demand would be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Meanwhile, in developed countries, the automotive industry has slowed. [ 13 ] It is also expected that this trend will continue, especially as the younger generations of people (in highly urbanized countries) no longer want to own a car, and prefer other modes of transport. [ 14 ] Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia . [ 15 ] Emerging automobile markets already buy more cars than established markets. According to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study, performed in 2010 expected this trend to accelerate. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] However, more recent reports (2012) confirmed the opposite; namely that the automotive industry was slowing down even in BRIC countries. [ 13 ] In the United States, vehicle sales peaked in 2000, at 17.8 million units. [ 18 ] In July 2021, the European Commission released its "" Fit for 55 "" legislation package, [ 19 ] which contains important guidelines for the future of the automotive industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035. [ 20 ] The governments of 24 developed countries and a group of major car manufacturers including GM , Ford , Volvo , BYD Auto , Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz committed to ""work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets"". [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Major car manufacturing nations like the United States, Germany, China, Japan and South Korea, as well as Volkswagen , Toyota , Peugeot , Honda , Nissan and Hyundai , did not pledge. [ 23 ] Environmental impacts [ edit ] Trucks' share of US vehicles produced, has tripled since 1975. Though vehicle fuel efficiency has increased within each category, the overall trend toward less efficient types of vehicles has offset some of the benefits of greater fuel economy and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 24 ] Without the shift towards SUVs, energy use per unit distance could have fallen 30% more than it did from 2010 to 2022. [ 25 ] The global automotive industry is a major consumer of water. Some estimates surpass 180,000 L (39,000 imp gal) of water per car manufactured, depending on whether tyre production is included. Production processes that use a significant volume of water include surface treatment, painting, coating, washing, cooling, air-conditioning, and boilers, not counting component manufacturing. Paintshop operations consume especially large amounts of water because equipment running on water-based products must also be cleaned with water. [ 26 ] In 2022, Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg ran into legal challenges due to droughts and falling groundwater levels in the region. Brandenburg's Economy Minister Joerg Steinbach said that while water supply was sufficient during the first stage, more would be needed once Tesla expands the site. The factory would nearly double the water consumption in the Gruenheide area, with 1.4 million cubic meters being contracted from local authorities per year — enough for a city of around 40,000 people. Steinbach said that the authorities would like to drill for more water there and outsource any additional supply if necessary.

[ 29 ] 1950s : United Kingdom, Germany, and France restarted production. 1960s : Japan started expanding production and increased volume through the 1980s. United States, Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom produced about 80% of motor vehicles through the 1980s. 1990s : South Korea became a volume producer. In 2004, Korea became No. 5 passing France. 2000s : China increased its production drastically, and became the world's largest-producing country in 2009. 2010s : India overtakes Korea, Canada, Spain to become 5th largest automobile producer. 2013 : The share of China (25.4%), India, Korea, Brazil, and Mexico rose to 43%, while the share of United States (12.7%), Japan, Germany, France, and United Kingdom fell to 34%. 2018 : India overtakes Germany to become 4th largest automobile producer.

Modes of transport include air , land ( rail and road ), water , cable , pipelines , and space . The field can be divided into infrastructure , vehicles , and operations. Transport enables human trade , which is essential for the development of civilizations . Transport infrastructure consists of both fixed installations, including roads , railways , airways , waterways , canals , and pipelines , and terminals such as airports , railway stations , bus stations , warehouses , trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fuel docks and fuel stations ), and seaports . Terminals may be used both for the interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance. Means of transport are any of the different kinds of transport facilities used to carry people or cargo. They may include vehicles, riding animals , and pack animals . Vehicles may include wagons , automobiles , bicycles , buses , trains , trucks , helicopters , watercraft , spacecraft , and aircraft . Modes [ edit ] Main article: Mode of transport Various modes of transport in Manchester , England A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a certain type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called inter-modal or multi-modal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen on the basis of cost, capability, and route. Governments deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode. Passenger transport may be public , where operators provide scheduled services, or private . Freight transport has become focused on containerization , although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization , but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land . While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl . Human-powered [ edit ] Main article: Human-powered transport Human-powered transport remains common in developing countries. Human-powered transport, a form of sustainable transport , is the transport of people or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking , running , and swimming . Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure , physical exercise , and environmentalism ; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions. Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates . Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing ; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft . Animal-powered [ edit ] Main article: Animal-powered transport Elephant transporting a person and some cargo on a highway between Delhi and Jaipur, India Animal-powered transport is the use of working animals for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams , to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles . Air [ edit ] Main article: Aviation An Air France Airbus A318 landing at London Heathrow Airport A fixed-wing aircraft , commonly called an airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing aircraft , where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A gyroplane is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo aircraft. Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing . The majority of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure for maintenance, restocking, and refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. [ 1 ] While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water. The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket . Commercial jets can reach up to 955 kilometres per hour (593 mph), single-engine aircraft 555 kilometres per hour (345 mph). Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, helicopters can be used. [ 2 ] As of April 28, 2009, The Guardian article notes that ""the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time."" [ 3 ] Land [ edit ] Main article: Land transport Land transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods, and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in urban planning . It consists of two kinds, rail and road. Rail [ edit ] Main article: Rail transport Intercity Express , a German high-speed passenger train The Beijing Subway is one of the world's largest and busiest rapid transit networks. Rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails, known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete, or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge . The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include monorail and maglev . A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive , that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by steam , by diesel , or by electricity supplied by trackside systems . Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple unit . Also, a train can be powered by horses , cables , gravity , pneumatics , and gas turbines . Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more energy efficient , though not as efficient as ships. Intercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities; [ 4 ] modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph), but this requires specially built track. Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity tramways and rapid transits , often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. Freight trains traditionally used box cars , requiring manual loading and unloading of the cargo . Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains. Road [ edit ] Main article: Road transport Road transport A road is an identifiable route , way, or path between two or more places . [ 5 ] Roads are typically smoothed, paved , or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel; [ 6 ] though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance . [ 7 ] In urban areas , roads may pass through a city or village and be named as streets , serving a dual function as urban space easement and route. [ 8 ] The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor . Other users of roads include buses , trucks , motorcycles , bicycles , and pedestrians . As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide. Road transport offers complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport. Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful noise and air pollution in cities; [ 9 ] buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility. [ 4 ] Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport. Water [ edit ] Main article: Maritime transport Automobile ferry in Croatia Water transport is movement by means of a watercraft —such as a barge , boat , ship , or sailboat —over a body of water, such as a sea , ocean , lake , canal , or river . The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance, and appearance. In the 19th century, the first steam ships were developed, using a steam engine to drive a paddle wheel or propeller to move the ship. The steam was produced in a boiler using wood or coal and fed through a steam external combustion engine . Now most ships have an internal combustion engine using a slightly refined type of petroleum called bunker fuel . Some ships, such as submarines , use nuclear power to produce the steam. Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers or, in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See Marine propulsion .) Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. Commercial vessels , nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4 billion tons of cargo in 2007. [ 10 ] Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental shipping ; [ 11 ] short sea shipping and ferries remain viable in coastal areas. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Other modes [ edit ] Trans-Alaska Pipeline for crude oil Pipeline transport sends goods through a pipe ; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but pneumatic tubes can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for sewage , slurry , water , and beer , while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas . Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep gradient . Typical solutions include aerial tramways , elevators , and ski lifts ; some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport. Spaceflight is transport outside Earth's atmosphere by means of a spacecraft . It is most frequently used for satellites placed in Earth orbit. However, human spaceflight mission have landed on the Moon and are occasionally used to rotate crew-members to space stations . Uncrewed spacecraft have also been sent to all the planets of the Solar System. Suborbital spaceflight is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant ""other place"" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a low Earth orbit or by following that trajectory even faster, using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it. Elements [ edit ] Infrastructure [ edit ] Main article: Infrastructure Bridges, such as Golden Gate Bridge , allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water. Tunnels, such as the Tampere Tunnel , allow traffic to pass underground or through rock formations. Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road, and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the airway and seaway do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals. Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, airport rail links connect airports to the city centres and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are parking lots , while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops. [ 14 ] For freight, terminals act as transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use. The financing of infrastructure can either be public or private . Transport is often a natural monopoly and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports, are funded through taxation . New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through debt . Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports or toll plazas on roads. Independent of this, authorities"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport,"ve high costs and are often financed through debt . Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports or toll plazas on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose taxes on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects. [ 15 ] Means of transport [ edit ] Animals [ edit ] Animals used in transportation include pack animals and riding animals . Vehicles [ edit ] Main article: Vehicle A Fiat Uno in 2018 Customized motorcycle to maximize load capacity. Mobility is important for motorcycles, which are primarily used for transporting light cargo in urban areas. A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a steam engine , combustion engine , electric motor , jet engine , or rocket , though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels , propellers , and pressure . Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver . However, some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated . For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles, or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver. Recently, the progress related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought a lot of new emerging technologies for transportation and automotive fields such as Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Driving. These innovations are said to form future mobility, but concerns remain on safety and cybersecurity, particularly concerning connected and autonomous mobility. [ 16 ] Operation [ edit ] Incheon International Airport , South Korea Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through private enterprise or by governments . The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a national airline and national railway . Since the 1980s, many of these have been privatized . International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation, [ 17 ] but ports can be public-owned. [ 18 ] Policy [ edit ] Further information: List of ministries of transport by country and Traffic management This section is missing information about most of what constitutes official traffic management and planning, how it integrates with other fields of politics and how it is enforced. Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page . ( December 2021 ) As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population—according to the United Nations, 55% of the world's population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%. [ 19 ] Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world. [ 20 ] The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives. Functions [ edit ] Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare , or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment. Passenger [ edit ] Main articles: Travel and Public transit A local transit bus operated by ACTION in Canberra , Australia Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into public and private transport . Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily commuting or for business , leisure, or migration . Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams, and rapid transit in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, coaches , and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. Intermodal passenger transport is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a transport hub , such as a bus or railway station . Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is demand-responsive transport , offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable. International travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and visa requirements. Medical [ edit ] An ambulance from World War I An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment, [ 21 ] and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going ""emergency ambulances"", which form part of emergency medical services , administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems. Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Freight [ edit ] Main article: Shipping A bulk carrier , BW Fjord Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the value chain in manufacturing. [ 24 ] With increased specialization and globalization , production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport. [ 25 ] Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. [ 26 ] While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen. [ 27 ] Logistics refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information. [ 28 ] Incoterm deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport. [ 29 ] Freight train with shipping containers in the United Kingdom Containerization , with the standardization of ISO containers on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic trade , offering a huge reduction in transshipment costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in economy of scale in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s. [ 30 ] Bulk transport is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are ore , coal, cereals , and petroleum . Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline. Air freight has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as postponement and just-in-time within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio. [ 31 ] In addition to mail, common items sent by air include electronics and fashion clothing. Industry [ edit ] Main article: Transport industry Impact [ edit ] Main article: Sustainable transport Economic [ edit ] Main article: Transport economics Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in Seattle, Washington , United States. Transport is a key necessity for specialization —allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations. Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more trade and a greater spread of people. Economic growth has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport. [ 32 ] But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue. Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of tourism , a major part of recreational transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed. In lean thinking , transporting materials or work in process from one location to another is seen as one of the seven wastes (Japanese term: muda ) which do not add value to a product. [ 33 ] Planning [ edit ] Main article: Transport planning Transport planning allows for high use and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of transport forecasting , planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain . Transport as a field is also studied through transport economics , a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. Transport engineering , a sub-discipline of civil engineering , must take into account trip generation , trip distribution , mode choice , and route assignment , while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering . The engineering of this roundabout in Bristol , United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving. Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy of the commons , where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. Density of development depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial use. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are economies of agglomeration . Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transport facilities consume land, and in cities pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste. Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology, and economics—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned. Environment [ edit ] Global greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in 2016: [ 34 ] Cars (40%) Trucks (34%) Planes (11%) Boats (11%) Trains (4%) Main article: Environmental impact of transport Traffic congestion persists in São Paulo , Brazil, despite the no-drive days based on license numbers. Transport is a major use of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum . This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates , and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide , [ 35 ] for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector. [ 36 ] According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the transportation sector accounts for more than one-third of CO2 emissions globally in the early 2020ies. [ 37 ] By sub-sector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming. [ 38 ] Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle. [ 35 ] Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased transport electrification and energy efficiency . Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl , which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transport emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's air quality , acid rain , smog , and climate change. [ 41 ] While electric cars are being built to cut down CO 2 emission at the point of use, an approach that is becoming popular among cities worldwide is to prioritize public transport, bicycles, and pedestrian movement . Redirecting vehicle movement to create 20-minute neighbourhoods [ 42 ] that promotes exercise while greatly reducing vehicle dependency and pollution. Some policies are levying a congestion charge [ 43 ] t"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport,"ecting vehicle movement to create 20-minute neighbourhoods [ 42 ] that promotes exercise while greatly reducing vehicle dependency and pollution. Some policies are levying a congestion charge [ 43 ] to cars for travelling within congested areas during peak time. Airplane emissions change depending on the flight distance. It takes a lot of energy to take off and land, so longer flights are more efficient per mile traveled. However, longer flights naturally use more fuel in total. Short flights produce the most CO 2 per passenger mile, while long flights produce slightly less. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Things get worse when planes fly high in the atmosphere . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Their emissions trap much more heat than those released at ground level. This is not just because of CO 2 , but a mix of other greenhouse gases in the exhaust. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] In 2022 global CO2 emissions from the transport sector grew by more than 250 Mt CO2 to nearly 8 Gt CO2, which represent more than 3% compared to 2021. Aviation was responsible for a significant part of that increase. [ 50 ] City buses produce about 0.3 kg of CO 2 for every mile traveled per passenger. For long-distance bus trips (over 20 miles), that pollution drops to about 0.08 kg of CO 2 per passenger mile. [ 51 ] [ 44 ] On average, commuter trains produce around 0.17 kg of CO 2 for each mile traveled per passenger. Long-distance trains are slightly higher at about 0.19 kg of CO 2 per passenger mile. [ 51 ] [ 44 ] [ 52 ] The fleet emission average for delivery vans, trucks and big rigs is 10.17 kg (22.4 lb) CO 2 per gallon of diesel consumed. Delivery vans and trucks average about 7.8 mpg (or 1.3 kg of CO 2 per mile) while big rigs average about 5.3 mpg (or 1.92 kg of CO 2 per mile). [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Sustainable development [ edit ] The United Nations first formally recognized the role of transport in sustainable development in the 1992 United Nations Earth summit . In the 2012 United Nations World Conference, global leaders unanimously recognized that transport and mobility are central to achieving the sustainability targets. In recent years, data has been collected to show that the transport sector contributes to a quarter of the global greenhouse gas emissions , and therefore sustainable transport has been mainstreamed across several of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals , especially those related to food, security, health, energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and cities and human settlements. Meeting sustainable transport targets is said to be particularly important to achieving the Paris Agreement . [ 55 ] There are various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are promoting sustainable transport to meet the defined goals. These include SDG 3 on health (increased road safety), SDG 7 on energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on resilient infrastructure, SDG 11 on sustainable cities (access to transport and expanded public transport), SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production (ending fossil fuel subsidies ), and SDG 14 on oceans, seas, and marine resources. [ 56 ] Contemporary development studies recognise transportation networks as a key element of economic development, socio-economic well-being and poverty reduction. [ 57 ] However, road network development has not always fulfilled its original intentions and has contributed significantly to environmental degradation and, in some cases, led to the loss of cultural traditions and the marginalisation of indigenous peoples. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] </ref> Compared to roads, the development of air links (helicopters and planes) has had an even more devastating impact. What is more, helicopters used for tourist activities are subject to considerable criticism from a perspective of environmental protection as well as sports ethics. [ 60 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of transport Further information: Timeline of transportation technology Bronocice pot with the earliest known image of a wheeled vehicle in the world, found in Poland A bullock team hauling wool in Australia Natural [ edit ] Humans' first ways to move included walking, running, and swimming. The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled (U.K. sledge) helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles . The first forms of road transport involved animals, such as horses ( domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE), [ 61 ] or humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trails . Water transport [ edit ] Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to time immemorial and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the Industrial Revolution . The first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree trunks . Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Mechanical [ edit ] Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible. [ citation needed ] The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw several inventions fundamentally change transport. With telegraphy , communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the steam engine , closely followed by its application in rail transport , made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the steam ship , which sped up global transport. With the development of the combustion engine and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first ""modern"" highways were constructed during the 19th century [ citation needed ] with macadam . Later, tarmac and concrete became the dominant paving materials. The Wright brothers ' first flight in 1903 In 1903 the Wright brothers demonstrated the first successful controllable airplane , and after World War I (1914–1918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances. [ 62 ] After World War II (1939–1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services. [ 63 ] Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization . [ 30 ] International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the jet engine . Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. After the introduction of the Shinkansen in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines. [ 63 ] Early in U.S. history , [ when? ] private joint-stock corporations owned most aqueducts , bridges , canals , railroads , roads , and tunnels . Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of Amtrak . Recently, [ when? ] however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some [ quantify ] ground and adherents.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Typically nonprofit organization seeking to further a particular profession A professional association (also called a professional body , professional organization , or professional society ) is a group that usually seeks to further a particular profession , the interests of individuals and organisations engaged in that profession, and the public interest . In the United States, such an association is typically a nonprofit business league for tax purposes. [ 1 ] In the UK, they may take a variety of legal forms. [ 2 ] Roles [ edit ] The roles of professional associations have been variously defined: ""A group of people in a learned occupation who are entrusted with maintaining control or oversight of the legitimate practice of the occupation;"" [ 3 ] also a body acting ""to safeguard the public interest;"" [ 4 ] organizations which ""represent the interest of the professional practitioners,"" and so ""act to maintain their own privileged and powerful position as a controlling body."" [ 4 ] Professional associations are ill defined although often have commonality in purpose and activities. [ 5 ] In the UK the Science Council defines a professional body as ""an organisation with individual members practicing a profession or occupation in which the organisation maintains an oversight of the knowledge, skills, conduct and practice of that profession or occupation"". [ 6 ] The Quality Assurance Agency distinguishes between statutory bodies and regulators that ""have powers mandated by Parliament to regulate a profession or group of professions and protect the use of professional titles"" and professional bodies that ""are independent membership organisations that oversee the activities of a particular profession and represent the interests of [their] members"" and which ""may offer registration or certification of unregulated occupations on a voluntary basis."" [ 7 ] Many professional bodies are involved in accrediting degrees, defining and examining the skills and competencies necessary to practice, and granting professional certifications to indicate that a person is qualified in the subject area. [ 8 ] Many professional bodies also act as learned societies for the academic disciplines underlying their professions, [ 1 ] [ 9 ] such as the American Statistical Association .

Yoga not only provides physical and mental relaxation but also develops strength and resilience. The numerous benefits of Yoga make it a popular practice for people across the globe, especially in times of a pandemic when mental and physical health is under stress. Beyond its immediate impact on physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated psychological suffering and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, due to the pandemic-related restrictions and its after effects. The message of Yoga in promoting both the physical and mental well-being of humanity has never been more relevant. A growing trend of people around the world embracing Yoga to stay healthy and rejuvenated and to fight social isolation and depression has been witnessed during the pandemic. Yoga is also playing a significant role in the psycho-social care and rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients in quarantine and isolation. It is particularly helpful in allaying their fears and anxiety. Recognizing this important role of Yoga, the commemoration of the International Day of Yoga in 2021 focused on “Yoga for well-being” – how the practice of Yoga can promote the holistic health of every individual. Like the year 2020, faculty and staff of AKGEC practiced Yoga at home with their families and shared their pictures with the College. Colonel M.K. Pandey, Retired, guided the faculty and staff through the yogasans online.

It is a federal republic of 50 states and the federal capital district of Washington, D.C. The 48 contiguous states border Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, with the state of Alaska forming a semi-exclave in the northwest and the state of Hawaii spanning an archipelago in Oceania . Indian country includes 574 federally recognized tribes and 326 Indian reservations with tribal sovereignty rights . The U.S. asserts sovereignty over five major island territories and various uninhabited islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean . It is an ecologically megadiverse country , with the world's third-largest land area [ c ] and third-largest population , exceeding 340 million. [ j ] Paleo-Indians migrated to North America across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago, and formed various cultures . Spanish Florida , the first European colony in what is now the continental U.S., was established in 1513, and later British colonization led to the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Intensive agriculture in the rapidly expanding Southern Colonies encouraged the enslavement of Africans . Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation sparked the American Revolution , with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776. The U.S. emerged victorious from the American Revolutionary War of 1775 to 1783 and expanded westward across North America, dispossessing Native Americans during the Indian Wars . The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848 saw significant territorial acquisition. As more states were admitted, a North–South division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America , which fought the Union in the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865. With the Union's victory, slavery was abolished nationally. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S. established itself as a great power following the Spanish–American War and World War I . After Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II ; its aftermath left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's superpowers . During the Cold War , both countries struggled for ideological dominance and international influence . The Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991 left the U.S. as the world's sole superpower. The U.S. national government , as established by the Constitution in 1789, is a presidential republic and liberal democracy with a separation of powers into three branches: legislative , executive , and judicial . The U.S. Congress , the national legislature, is composed of the House of Representatives (a lower house based on population) and the Senate (an upper house based on equal representation for each state). The U.S. federal system provides substantial autonomy to the 50 states, each with its own constitution and laws. The American political tradition is rooted in Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, individual rights, and the rule of law. Since the 1850s, the Democratic and Republican parties have dominated American politics . A developed country , the U.S. ranks high in economic competitiveness , productivity , innovation, and higher education. The U.S. accounted for over a quarter of nominal global economic output in 2024, and its economy has been the world's largest by nominal GDP since about 1890 . It possesses the most wealth of any country and has the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries, though U.S. wealth inequality is one of the most pronounced in those countries. A melting pot of many ethnicities and customs , the culture of the U.S. has been shaped by centuries of immigration, and its soft power influence has a global reach. The U.S. is a member of multiple international organizations and plays a leading role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs. Etymology Further information: Names of the United States , Demonyms for the United States , United Colonies , and Naming of the Americas Documented use of the phrase ""United States of America"" dates back to January 2, 1776. On that day, Stephen Moylan , a Continental Army aide to General George Washington , wrote a letter to Joseph Reed , Washington's aide-de-camp , seeking to go ""with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain"" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The first known public usage is an anonymous essay published in the Williamsburg newspaper The Virginia Gazette on April 6, 1776. [ 21 ] Sometime on or after June 11, 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote ""United States of America"" in a rough draft of the Declaration of Independence , [ 21 ] which was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. [ 23 ] The term ""United States"" and its initialism ""U.S."", used as nouns or as adjectives in English, are common short names for the country. The initialism ""USA"", a noun, is also common. [ 24 ] ""United States"" and ""U.S."" are the established terms throughout the U.S. federal government , with prescribed rules. [ k ] ""The States"" is an established colloquial shortening of the name, used particularly from abroad; [ 26 ] ""stateside"" is the corresponding adjective or adverb. [ 27 ] ""America"" is the feminine form of the first word of Americus Vesputius , the Latinized name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512); it was first used as a place name by the German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann in 1507. [ 28 ] [ l ] Vespucci first proposed that the West Indies discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 were part of a previously unknown landmass and not among the Indies at the eastern limit of Asia. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] In English, the term ""America"" rarely refers to topics unrelated to the United States, despite the usage of ""the Americas "" to describe the totality of North and South America . [ 32 ] History Main article: History of the United States For a topical guide, see Outline of the history of the United States . Indigenous peoples Main articles: History of Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era Cliff Palace , a settlement of ancestors of the Native American Pueblo peoples in present-day Montezuma County, Colorado , built between c. 1200 and 1275 [ 33 ] The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia over 12,000 years ago, either across the Bering land bridge or along the now-submerged Ice Age coastline . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] The Clovis culture , which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Over time, Indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture , developed agriculture , architecture , and complex societies . [ 38 ] In the post-archaic period , the Mississippian cultures were located in the midwestern , eastern , and southern regions, and the Algonquian in the Great Lakes region and along the Eastern Seaboard , while the Hohokam culture and Ancestral Puebloans inhabited the southwest . [ 39 ] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000 [ 40 ] [ 41 ] to nearly 10 million. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] European exploration, colonization and conflict (1513–1765) Main articles: Colonial history of the United States and Colonial American military history The colonial possessions of Britain (the Thirteen Colonies in pink and others in purple), France (in blue), and Spain (in orange) in North America, 1750 Christopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean for Spain in 1492, leading to Spanish-speaking settlements and missions from Puerto Rico and Florida to New Mexico and California . The first Spanish colony in what is now the continental United States was Spanish Florida , chartered in 1513. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] After several settlements failed there due to hunger and disease, Spain's first permanent town, Saint Augustine , was founded in 1565. [ 47 ] France established its own settlements in French Florida in 1562, but they were either abandoned (Charlesfort, 1578) or destroyed by Spanish raids ( Fort Caroline , 1565); permanent French settlements would be founded much later along the Great Lakes ( Fort Detroit , 1701), the Mississippi River (Saint Louis, 1764) and especially the Gulf of Mexico ( New Orleans , 1718). [ 48 ] Early European colonies also included the thriving Dutch colony of New Nederland (settled 1626, present-day New York) and the small Swedish colony of New Sweden (settled 1638 in what is now Delaware). British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and the Plymouth Colony (Massachusetts, 1620). [ 49 ] [ 50 ] The Mayflower Compact in Massachusetts and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts. [ 53 ] [ m ] Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade . [ 59 ] The original Thirteen Colonies [ n ] that would later found the United States were administered as possessions of Great Britain , [ 60 ] and had local governments with elections open to most white male property owners . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The colonial population grew rapidly from Maine to Georgia, eclipsing Native American populations; [ 63 ] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. [ 64 ] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [ 65 ] and the First Great Awakening , a series of Christian revivals , fueled colonial interest in religious liberty . [ 66 ] American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800) Main articles: History of the United States (1776–1789) , History of the United States (1789–1815) , and American Revolution Declaration of Independence , a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia Following their victory in the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in colonial political resistance ; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen , particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them . To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the First Continental Congress met in 1774 and passed the Continental Association , a colonial boycott of British goods that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord , igniting the American Revolutionary War . At the Second Continental Congress , the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army , and created a committee that named Thomas Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence . Two days after passing the Lee Resolution to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776. [ 67 ] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty , inalienable individual rights ; and the sovereignty of the people ; [ 68 ] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy , aristocracy , and all hereditary political power; civic virtue ; and vilification of political corruption .

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States,"editary political power; civic virtue ; and vilification of political corruption . [ 69 ] The Founding Fathers of the United States , who included Washington, Jefferson, John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , James Madison , Thomas Paine , and many others, were inspired by Greco-Roman , Renaissance , and Enlightenment philosophies and ideas. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were ratified in 1781 and established a decentralized government that operated until 1789. [ 67 ] After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida . [ 72 ] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states , rather than the expansion of existing states. [ 73 ] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a federal republic governed by three separate branches that together ensured a system of checks and balances . [ 74 ] George Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government. [ 75 ] His resignation as commander-in-chief after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the United States and the peaceful transfer of power . [ 76 ] Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865) Main articles: History of the United States (1815–1849) and History of the United States (1849–1865) Territorial expansion of the United States The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Lingering issues with Britain remained , leading to the War of 1812 , which was fought to a draw. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819. [ 81 ] In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward , many with a sense of manifest destiny . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The Missouri Compromise of 1820, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. The compromise further prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36°30′ parallel . [ 84 ] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation . [ 85 ] [ 86 ] The most significant such legislation in U.S. history was the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , a key policy of President Andrew Jackson . It culminated in the Trail of Tears (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, resulting in 13,200 to 16,700 deaths. [ 87 ] These and earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] The United States annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845, [ 90 ] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest . [ 91 ] Dispute with Mexico over Texas led to the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). After the victory of the U.S., Mexico recognized U.S sovereignty over Texas, New Mexico , and California in the 1848 Mexican Cession ; the cession's lands also included the future states of Nevada , Colorado and Utah . [ 82 ] [ 92 ] The California gold rush of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the mid-1870s. [ 93 ] Additional western territories and states were created. [ 94 ] Division of the states during the American Civil War : Union Confederacy Border states Territories During the colonial period, slavery had been legal in the American colonies , especially in the agriculture-intensive Southern Colonies from Maryland to Georgia. The practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution. [ 95 ] Spurred by an active abolitionist movement that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in the North enacted anti-slavery laws. [ 96 ] At the same time, support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states with inventions such as the cotton gin (1793), which had long made the institution profitable for Southern elites . [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] Throughout the 1850s, this sectional conflict regarding slavery was further inflamed by legislation in Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court: The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 mandated the return of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states to their owners in the South. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise. [ 100 ] Finally, in its Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory and declared the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These events exacerbated tensions between North and South that would culminate in the American Civil War (1861–1865). [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Beginning with South Carolina , eleven slave states seceded from the United States in 1861 to form the Confederate States of America . All other states remained in the Union . [ o ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation , many freed slaves joined the Union army . [ 107 ] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg , and the Confederates surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House . [ 108 ] The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln , Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans , abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude, establishing equal protection of the laws for all persons, and prohibiting discrimination in citizens' voting rights on the basis of race or previous enslavement. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] Reconstruction, Gilded Age, and Progressive Era (1865–1917) Main article: History of the United States (1865–1917) An Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor , a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries [ 112 ] [ 113 ] National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads , spurred growth in the American frontier . [ 114 ] From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe. [ 115 ] Most came through the port of New York City , and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish , Irish , and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest . At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England . [ 116 ] During the Great Migration , millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North. [ 117 ] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867. [ 118 ] The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations . [ 121 ] [ 122 ] A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson , emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in communities across the country , which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation . [ 123 ] An explosion of technological advancement accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor [ 124 ] led to rapid economic expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , allowing the United States to outpace the economies of England, France, and Germany combined. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] This fostered the amassing of power by a few prominent industrialists , largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition. [ 127 ] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad , petroleum , and steel industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry . [ 128 ] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality , slum conditions , and social unrest , creating the environment for labor unions and socialist movements to begin to flourish. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era , which was characterized by significant reforms. [ 132 ] [ 133 ] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy ; the islands were annexed in 1898. That same year, Puerto Rico , the Philippines , and Guam were ceded to the U.S. by Spain after the latter's defeat in the Spanish–American War . (The Philippines was granted full independence from the U.S. on July 4, 1946, following World War II. Puerto Rico and Guam have remained U.S. territories.) [ 134 ] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War . [ 135 ] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917. [ 136 ] World War I, Great Depression, and World War II (1917–1945) Main article: History of the United States (1917–1945) The 1945 Trinity test , during which the U.S. conducted the first-ever detonation of a nuclear weapon The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies in 1917 helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers . [ 137 ] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage . [ 138 ] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and early television transformed communications nationwide. [ 139 ] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression , which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with the New Deal , a series of sweeping programs and public works projects combined with financial reforms and regulations . All were intended to protect against future economic depressions. [ 140 ] [ 141 ] Initially neutral during World War II , the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor . [ 142 ] [ 143 ] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war. [ 144 ] [ 145 ] The United States was one of the "" Four Policemen "" who met to plan the post-war world , alongside the United Kingdom , Soviet Union , and China . [ 146 ] [ 147 ] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic power and international political influence . [ 148 ] Cold War between Superpowers (1945–1991) Main articles: History of the United States (1945–1964) , History of the United States (1964–1980) , and History of the United States (1980–1991) Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty at the White House in 1987. The end of World War II in 1945 left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as superpowers , each with its own political, military, and economic sphere of influence. Geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers soon led to the Cold War . [ 149 ] [ 150 ] [ 151 ] The U.S. utilized the policy of containment to limit the USSR's sphere of influence, engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with Moscow, and prevailed in the Space Race , which culminated with the first crewed Moon landing in 1969. [ 152 ] [ 153 ] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth , urbanization , and population growth following World War II . [ 154 ] The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s. [ 155 ] The Great Society plan of President Lyndon B. Johnson 's administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and a constitutional amendment to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering institutional racism . [ 156 ] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward recreational drug use and sexuality . [ 157 ] [ 158 ] It also encouraged open defiance of the military draft (leading to the end of conscription in 1973) and wide opposition to U.S. intervention in Vietnam (with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975). [ 159 ] A societal shift in the roles of women was significantly responsible for the large increase in female paid labor participation during the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of American women aged 16 and older were employed. [ 160 ] The fall of communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and left the United States as the world's sole superpower . [ 161 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ] This cemented the United States' global influence, reinforcing the concept of the "" American Century "" as it dominated international political, economic, and military affairs. [ 165 ] [ 166 ] Contemporary (1991–present) Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2016) and History of the United States (2016–present) The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks in 2001 The 1990s saw the longest recorded economic expansion in American history , a dramatic decline in U.S. crime rates , and advances in technology . Throughout this decade, technological innovations such as the World Wide Web , the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's law , rechargeable lithium-ion batteries , the first gene therapy trial, and cloning either emerged in the U.S. or were improved upon there. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990, while Nasdaq became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998. [ 167 ] In the Gulf War of 1991, an American-led international coalition of states expelled an Iraqi invasion force that had occupied neighboring Kuwait .

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] The U.S. housing bubble culminated in 2007 with the Great Recession , the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression. [ 171 ] Coming to a head in the 2010s, political polarization in the country increased between liberal and conservative factions. [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] This polarization was capitalized upon in the January 2021 Capitol attack , [ 175 ] when a mob of insurrectionists [ 176 ] entered the U.S. Capitol and sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power [ 177 ] in an attempted self-coup d'état . [ 178 ] The 2021 Taliban offensive (May–August) ended the War in Afghanistan one year after the U.S. signed a peace agreement with the Taliban. [ 179 ] Geography Main article: Geography of the United States A topographic map of the United States The United States is the world's third-largest country by total area behind Russia and Canada. [ c ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km 2 ). [ 12 ] [ 182 ] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region. [ 183 ] The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest . [ 184 ] The Mississippi River System , the world's fourth-longest river system , runs predominantly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat and fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast. [ 184 ] The Grand Canyon in Arizona The Rocky Mountains , west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado . [ 185 ] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua , Sonoran , and Mojave deserts. [ 186 ] In the northwest corner of Arizona , carved by the Colorado River over millions of years, is the Grand Canyon , a steep-sided canyon and popular tourist destination known for its overwhelming visual size and intricate, colorful landscape. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast . The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the State of California, [ 187 ] about 84 miles (135 km) apart. [ 188 ] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent. [ 189 ] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands . Located entirely outside North America, the archipelago of Hawaii consists of volcanic islands, physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania . [ 190 ] The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains, the Yellowstone Caldera , is the continent's largest volcanic feature. [ 191 ] In 2021, the United States had 8% of global permanent meadows and pastures and 10% of cropland. [ 192 ] Climate Main article: Climate of the United States The Köppen climate types of the United States With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian , the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. [ 193 ] The western Great Plains are semi-arid . [ 194 ] Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate . The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California , and oceanic in coastal Oregon , Washington , and southern Alaska . Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar . Hawaii , the southern tip of Florida and U.S. territories in the Caribbean and Pacific are tropical . [ 195 ] The United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country , mainly in Tornado Alley . [ 198 ] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest , droughts became more persistent and more severe. [ 199 ] The regions considered as the most attractive to the population are the most vulnerable. [ 200 ] Biodiversity and conservation Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States The bald eagle , the national emblem of the United States since 1782 and officially declared the national bird in 2024 [ 201 ] The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species : about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. [ 202 ] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians , [ 203 ] and around 91,000 insect species. [ 204 ] There are 63 national parks , and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas , managed by the National Park Service and other agencies. [ 205 ] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed, [ 206 ] primarily in the Western States . [ 207 ] Most of this land is protected , though some is leased for commercial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes. [ 208 ] [ 209 ] Environmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy , air and water pollution , biodiversity , logging and deforestation , [ 210 ] [ 211 ] and climate change . [ 212 ] [ 213 ] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues . [ 214 ] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act . [ 215 ] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act. [ 216 ] In 2024, the U.S. ranked 35th among 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index . [ 217 ] Government and politics Main article: Politics of the United States The U.S. Capitol Building , the seat of legislative government, is home to both chambers of the U.S. Congress : the Senate and the House of Representatives . The White House , the residence and workplace of the U.S. president and the offices of the presidential staff The Supreme Court Building , which houses the nation's highest court The United States is a federal republic of 50 states , and a federal capital district, Washington, D.C. The U.S. also asserts sovereignty over five unincorporated territories and several uninhabited island possessions . [ 218 ] [ 219 ] The U.S. is the world's oldest surviving federation, [ 220 ] and its presidential system of national government has been adopted, in whole or in part, by many newly independent states worldwide following their decolonization . [ 221 ] The Constitution of the United States serves as the country's supreme legal document . [ 222 ] Most scholars describe the United States as a liberal democracy. [ 223 ] [ p ] National government Main article: Federal government of the United States Composed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. It is regulated by a strong system of checks and balances . [ 234 ] The U.S. Congress , a bicameral legislature made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives , makes federal law , declares war , approves treaties, has the power of the purse , [ 235 ] and has the power of impeachment . [ 236 ] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members, each elected for a two-year term; all representatives serve one congressional district of equivalent population. Congressional districts are drawn by each state legislature and are contiguous within the state. [ 237 ] The Congress also organizes a collection of committees , each of which handles a specific task or duty. One of Congress's foremost non-legislative functions is the power to investigate and oversee the executive branch. [ 238 ] Congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by Congress's subpoena power. [ 239 ] The U.S. president is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the military, chief executive of the federal government, and has the ability to veto legislative bills from the U.S. Congress before they become law. However, presidential vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds supermajority vote in both chambers of Congress. The president appoints the members of the Cabinet , subject to Senate approval, and names other officials who administer and enforce federal laws through their respective agencies . [ 240 ] The president also has clemency power for federal crimes and can issue pardons . Finally, the president has the right to issue expansive "" executive orders "", subject to judicial review , in a number of policy areas. Candidates for president campaign with a vice-presidential running mate . Both candidates are elected together, or defeated together, in a presidential election. Unlike other votes in American politics, this is technically an indirect election in which the winner will be determined by the U.S. Electoral College . There, votes are officially cast by individual electors selected by their state legislature . [ 241 ] In practice, however, each of the 50 states chooses a group of presidential electors who are required to confirm the winner of their state's popular vote. Each state is allocated two electors plus one additional elector for each congressional district , which in effect combines to equal the number of elected officials that state sends to Congress. The District of Columbia, with no representatives or senators, is allocated three electoral votes. Both the president and the vice president serve a four-year term, and the president may be reelected to the office only once , for one additional four-year term. [ q ] The U.S. federal judiciary , whose judges are all appointed for life by the president with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court , the U.S. courts of appeals , and the U.S. district courts . The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional . [ 242 ] The Supreme Court has nine members led by the Chief Justice of the United States . The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available. [ 243 ] The first level in the federal courts is federal district court for any case under "" original jurisdiction "", such as federal statutes, the Constitution, or treaties . There are twelve federal circuits that divide the country into different regions for federal appeals courts. After a federal district court has decided a case, it can then be appealed to a United States court of appeal. The next and highest court in the system is the Supreme Court of the United States. [ 242 ] The three-branch system is known as the presidential system , in contrast to the parliamentary system , where the executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the world imitated this aspect of the 1789 Constitution of the United States , especially in the Americas. [ 244 ] Subdivisions Main articles: List of states and territories of the United States , List of federally recognized tribes by state , U.S. state , Federally recognized tribe , Indian country , Territories of the United States , and County (United States) Map of 326 Indian reservations in the United States; 231 recognized Alaska Native tribes are not shown. Territories of the United States include American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. Virgin Islands . In the U.S. federal system , sovereign powers are shared between three levels of government specified in the Constitution: the national government, the states, and Indian tribes. [ 245 ] [ 246 ] The U.S. also asserts sovereignty over five permanently inhabited territories: American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. Virgin Islands . [ 218 ] Residents of the states are represented by their elected state and local governments , which are administrative divisions of the states. [ 247 ] States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities . The District of Columbia is a federal district containing the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C. [ 248 ] The federal district is an administrative division of the federal government. [ 249 ] Indian country is made up of 574 federally recognized tribes and 326 Indian reservations . They hold a government-to-government relationship with the U.S. federal government in Washington and are legally defined as domestic dependent nations with inherent tribal sovereignty rights . [ 246 ] [ 245 ] [ 250 ] [ 251 ] In addition to the five major territories, the U.S. also asserts sovereignty over the United States Minor Outlying Islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean . [ 218 ] The seven undisputed islands without permanent populations are Baker Island , Howland Island , Jarvis Island , Johnston Atoll , Kingman Reef , Midway Atoll , and Palmyra Atoll . U.S. sovereignty over the unpopulated Bajo Nuevo Bank , Navassa Island , Serranilla Bank , and Wake Island is disputed. [ 218 ] Political parties Main articles: Political parties in the United States , List of political parties in the United States , and Political party strength in U.S. states States and territories by partisan control, as of February 2025: Democratic Party Republican Party New Progressive Party Divided partisan control The Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed independently in the 18th century with the Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties. [ 252 ] Since then, the United States has operated as a de facto two-party system , though the parties in that system have been different at different times. [ 253 ] The two main national parties are presently the Democratic and the Republican . The former is perceived as relatively liberal in its political platform while the latter is perceived as relatively conservative .

It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , [ 255 ] and home to the United Nations headquarters . [ 256 ] The United States is a member of the G7 , [ 257 ] G20 , [ 258 ] and OECD intergovernmental organizations. [ 259 ] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all countries host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran , [ 260 ] North Korea , [ 261 ] and Bhutan . [ 262 ] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations. [ 263 ] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression. [ 264 ] Its geopolitical attention also turned to the Indo-Pacific when the United States joined the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan. [ 265 ] The United States has a "" Special Relationship "" with the United Kingdom [ 266 ] and strong ties with Canada , [ 267 ] Australia , [ 268 ] New Zealand , [ 269 ] the Philippines , [ 270 ] Japan , [ 271 ] South Korea , [ 272 ] Israel , [ 273 ] and several European Union countries ( France , Italy , Germany , Spain , and Poland ). [ 274 ] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with countries in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement . In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States. [ 275 ] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia , the Marshall Islands , and Palau through the Compact of Free Association . [ 242 ] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India , [ 276 ] while its ties with China have steadily deteriorated. [ 277 ] [ 278 ] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine . [ 279 ] [ 280 ] Military Main article: United States Armed Forces The Pentagon , the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense in Arlington County, Virginia , is one of the world's largest office buildings with over 6.5 million square feet (600,000 m 2 ) of floor space . The president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The Department of Defense , which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the U.S. Army , Marine Corps , Navy , Air Force , and Space Force . [ 281 ] The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime. [ 282 ] The United States spent $916 billion on its military in 2023, which is by far the largest amount of any country , making up 37% of global military spending and accounting for 3.4% of the country's GDP. [ 283 ] [ 284 ] The U.S. possesses 42% of the world's nuclear weapons —the second-largest stockpile after that of Russia . [ 285 ] The United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces . [ 286 ] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad, [ 287 ] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries. [ 288 ] The United States has engaged in over 400 military interventions since its founding in 1776, with over half of these occurring between 1950 and 2019 and 25% occurring in the post-Cold War era. [ 289 ] State defense forces (SDFs) are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government. SDFs are authorized by state and federal law but are under the command of the state's governor . [ 290 ] [ 291 ] [ 292 ] They are distinct from the state's National Guard units in that they cannot become federalized entities. A state's National Guard personnel, however, may be federalized under the National Defense Act Amendments of 1933 , which created the Guard and provides for the integration of Army National Guard units and personnel into the U.S. Army and (since 1947) the U.S. Air Force. [ 293 ] Law enforcement and criminal justice Main articles: Law of the United States , Law enforcement in the United States , and Crime in the United States J. Edgar Hoover Building , the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in Washington, D.C. There are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to national level in the United States. [ 294 ] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state , and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights , national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts ' rulings and federal laws. [ 295 ] State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials, [ 296 ] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals of state court decisions . [ 297 ] There is no unified ""criminal justice system"" in the United States. The American prison system is largely heterogenous, with thousands of relatively independent systems operating across federal, state, local, and tribal levels. In 2024, ""these systems hold over 1.9 million people in 1,566 state prisons, 98 federal prisons, 3,116 local jails, 1,323 juvenile correctional facilities, 142 immigration detention facilities, and 80 Indian country jails, as well as in military prisons , civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, and prisons in the U.S. territories."" [ 298 ] Despite disparate systems of confinement, four main institutions dominate: federal prisons , state prisons , local jails, and juvenile correctional facilities . [ 299 ] Federal prisons are run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and hold people who have been convicted of federal crimes, including pretrial detainees. [ 299 ] State prisons, run by the official department of correction of each state, hold sentenced people serving prison time (usually longer than one year) for felony offenses. [ 299 ] Local jails are county or municipal facilities that incarcerate defendants prior to trial; they also hold those serving short sentences (typically under a year). [ 299 ] Juvenile correctional facilities are operated by local or state governments and serve as longer-term placements for any minor adjudicated as delinquent and ordered by a judge to be confined. [ 300 ] In January 2023, the United States had the sixth-highest per capita incarceration rate in the world—531 people per 100,000 inhabitants—and the largest prison and jail population in the world, with more than 1.9 million people incarcerated. [ 298 ] [ 301 ] [ 302 ] An analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed U.S. homicide rates ""were 7 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25 times higher"". [ 303 ] Economy Main article: Economy of the United States The U.S. dollar is the most-used currency in international transactions and the world's foremost reserve currency . [ 304 ] The U.S. economy has been the world's largest nominally since about 1890 . [ 305 ] The 2024 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $29 trillion [ 306 ] [ e ] was the highest in the world, constituting over 25% of nominal global economic output or 15% at purchasing power parity (PPP). From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7 . [ 307 ] The country ranks first in the world by nominal GDP , [ 308 ] second when adjusted for purchasing power parities (PPP), [ 15 ] and ninth by PPP-adjusted GDP per capita . [ 15 ] It has the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries. [ 309 ] In February 2024, the total U.S. federal government debt was $34.4 trillion. [ 310 ] Microsoft , one of the world's largest companies by market capitalization in 2024, [ 311 ] has its global headquarters in Redmond, Washington . Of the world's 500 largest companies by revenue , 136 were headquartered in the U.S. in 2023, [ 312 ] which is the highest number of any country. [ 313 ] The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and the world's foremost reserve currency , backed by the country's dominant economy, its military , the petrodollar system, its large U.S. treasuries market , and its linked eurodollar . [ 304 ] Several countries use it as their official currency , and in others it is the de facto currency . [ 314 ] [ 315 ] The U.S. has free trade agreements with several countries , including the USMCA . [ 316 ] It ranked second in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019, after Singapore. [ 317 ] Although the United States has reached a post-industrial level of development [ 318 ] and is often described as having a service economy , [ 318 ] [ 319 ] it remains a major industrial power. [ 320 ] In 2021, the U.S. manufacturing sector was the world's second-largest after China's. [ 321 ] The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street , the world's largest stock exchange by market capitalization [ 322 ] New York City is the world's principal financial center [ 323 ] [ 324 ] and the epicenter of the world's largest metropolitan economy . [ 325 ] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq , both located in New York City, are the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume . [ 326 ] [ 327 ] The United States is at or near the forefront of technological advancement and innovation [ 328 ] in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence ; electronics and computers ; pharmaceuticals ; and medical, aerospace and military equipment . [ 180 ] The country's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources , a well-developed infrastructure , and high productivity . [ 329 ] The largest trading partners of the United States are the European Union , Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan. [ 330 ] The United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter . [ r ] It is by far the world's largest exporter of services . [ 333 ] Americans have the highest average household [ 334 ] and employee income among OECD member states, and the fourth-highest median household income in 2023, [ 335 ] up from sixth-highest in 2013. [ 336 ] With personal consumption expenditures of over $18.5 trillion in 2023, [ 337 ] the U.S. has a heavily consumer-driven economy and is the world's largest consumer market . [ 338 ] The U.S. ranked first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires in 2023, with 735 billionaires and nearly 22 million millionaires. [ 339 ] Wealth in the United States is highly concentrated; in 2011, the richest 10% of the adult population owned 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% owned just 2%. [ 340 ] U.S. wealth inequality increased substantially since the late 1980s, [ 341 ] and income inequality in the U.S. reached a record high in 2019. [ 342 ] By 2024, the country had some of the highest wealth and income inequality among OECD countries. [ 343 ] Since the 1970s, there has been a decoupling of U.S. wage gains from worker productivity. [ 344 ] In 2016, the top fifth of earners took home more than half of all income, [ 345 ] giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD countries. [ 346 ] [ 344 ] There were about 771,480 homeless persons in the U.S. in 2024. [ 347 ] In 2022, 6.4 million children experienced food insecurity. [ 348 ] Feeding America estimates that around one in five, or approximately 13 million, children experience hunger in the U.S. and do not know where they will get their next meal or when. [ 349 ] Also in 2022, about 37.9 million people, or 11.5% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty . [ 350 ] The United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries . [ 351 ] [ 352 ] It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally [ 353 ] and is one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right. [ 354 ] The United States has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed country, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers. [ 355 ] Science and technology Main article: Science and technology in the United States The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. [ 356 ] Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the large-scale manufacturing of U.S. consumer products in the late 19th century. [ 357 ] By the early 20th century, factory electrification , the introduction of the assembly line , and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production . [ 358 ] In the 21st century, the United States continues to be one of the world's foremost scientific powers, [ 359 ] though China has emerged as a major competitor in many fields. [ 360 ] The U.S. has the highest total research and development expenditure of any country [ 361 ] and ranks ninth as a percentage of GDP. [ 362 ] In 2022, the United States was (after China) the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers . [ 363 ] In 2021, the U.S. ranked second (also after China) by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications (after China and Germany), according to World Intellectual Property Indicators . [ 364 ] In 2023 and 2024, the United States ranked third (after Switzerland and Sweden) in the Global Innovation Index . [ 365 ] [ 366 ] The United States is considered to be the leading country in the development of artificial intelligence technology. [ 367 ] In 2023, the United States was ranked the second most technologically advanced country in the world (after South Korea) by Global Finance magazine.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States,"een in Aldrin's visor reflection along with the Earth , the Lunar Module Eagle , and the American flag . The United States is the only country to have landed human crews on the lunar surface. The United States has maintained a space program since the late 1950s, beginning with the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958. [ 369 ] [ 370 ] NASA's Apollo program (1961–1972) achieved the first crewed Moon landing with the 1969 Apollo 11 mission; it remains one of the agency's most significant milestones. [ 371 ] [ 372 ] Other major endeavors by NASA include the Space Shuttle program (1981–2011), [ 373 ] the Voyager program (1972–present), the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes (launched in 1990 and 2021, respectively), [ 374 ] [ 375 ] and the multi-mission Mars Exploration Program ( Spirit and Opportunity , Curiosity , and Perseverance ). [ 376 ] NASA is one of five agencies collaborating on the International Space Station (ISS); [ 377 ] U.S. contributions to the ISS include several modules, including Destiny (2001), Harmony (2007), and Tranquility (2010), as well as ongoing logistical and operational support. [ 378 ] The United States private sector dominates the global commercial spaceflight industry . [ 379 ] Prominent American spaceflight contractors include Blue Origin , Boeing , Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman , and SpaceX . NASA programs such as the Commercial Crew Program , Commercial Resupply Services , Commercial Lunar Payload Services , and NextSTEP have facilitated growing private-sector involvement in American spaceflight. [ 380 ] Energy Main article: Energy in the United States In 2023, the United States received approximately 84% of its energy from fossil fuel, and the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (38%), followed by natural gas (36%), renewable sources (9%), coal (9%), and nuclear power (9%). [ 381 ] [ 382 ] In 2022, the United States constituted only about 4% of the world's population , but consumed around 16% of the world's energy . [ 383 ] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China. [ 384 ] The U.S. is the world's largest producer of nuclear power , generating around 30% of the world's nuclear electricity. [ 385 ] It also has the highest number of nuclear power reactors of any country. [ 386 ] From 2024, the U.S. plans to triple its nuclear power capacity by 2050. [ 387 ] Transportation Main article: Transportation in the United States Interchange between Interstate 10 and Interstate 45 in Houston , Texas The automotive industry in the United States is the second-largest by motor vehicle manufacturing output , having dominated the world market for much of the twentieth century. Detroit, Michigan , is still referred to as ""Motor City"" because of its historical significance as the center of the American automobile industry, having been home to America's "" Big Three "" car manufacturers for a long time. The U.S. is in the top ten countries for highest vehicle ownership per capita , with 850 vehicles per 1000 people in 2022. The 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) road network, owned almost entirely by state and local governments, is the longest in the world . [ 388 ] [ 389 ] The extensive Interstate Highway System connects all major cities and is funded mostly by the federal government but maintained by state departments of transportation , supplemented by state expressways and some private toll roads . A 2022 study found that 76% of U.S. commuters drive alone and 14% ride a bicycle, including bike owners and users of bike-sharing networks. About 11% use some form of public transportation. [ 390 ] [ 391 ] Public transportation in the United States is well developed in the largest urban areas, notably New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and Portland, Oregon; otherwise, coverage is generally less extensive than in most other developed countries. The U.S. also has many relatively car-dependent localities. [ 392 ] Long-distance intercity travel is provided primarily by airlines, but travel by rail is more common along the Northeast Corridor , the only high-speed rail in the U.S. that meets international standards. Amtrak , the country's government-sponsored national passenger rail company, has a relatively sparse network compared to that of Western European countries. Service is concentrated in the Northeast, Illinois, and the West Coast. Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport , serving the Atlanta metropolitan area , is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic with over 75 million passengers as of 2021. [ 393 ] [ 394 ] The United States has an extensive air transportation network, and the country accounted for just over half of the world's aerospace production in 2016. [ 395 ] U.S. civilian airlines are all privately owned. The three largest airlines in the world, by total number of passengers carried, are U.S.-based; American Airlines became the global leader after its 2013 merger with US Airways . [ 396 ] Among the busiest 50 airports in the world, 16 are in the United States, as well as five of the top 10. [ 397 ] The world's busiest airport by passenger volume is Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International in Atlanta, Georgia . [ 393 ] [ 397 ] In 2022, most of the 19,969 U.S. airports [ 398 ] were owned and operated by local government authorities, and there are also some private airports. Some 5,193 are designated as ""public use"", including for general aviation . The Transportation Security Administration has provided security at most major airports since 2001. The country's rail transport network , the longest in the world at 182,412.3 mi (293,564.2 km), [ 399 ] handles mostly freight [ 400 ] [ 401 ] (in contrast to more passenger-centered rail in Europe [ 402 ] ). Because they are often privately owned operations as well, U.S. railroads lag behind those of the rest of the world in terms of electrification. [ 403 ] Of the world's 50 busiest container ports , four are located in the United States, with the busiest in the U.S. being the Port of Los Angeles . [ 404 ] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest , totaling 41,009 km (25,482 mi). [ 405 ] They are used extensively for freight, recreation, and a small amount of passenger traffic. Miami is a major international hub for cruise ship and airline passengers visiting the Caribbean . Transportation in Alaska relies more on airplanes, ferries, all-terrain vehicles , and snowmobiles because many settlements are not connected to the contiguous North American road network. Long distances and the requirements of the Jones Act result in higher transportation costs for Hawaii and insular areas from the rest of the United States. Demographics Main article: Demographics of the United States Population Main articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States See also: List of U.S. states by population The 10 most populous U.S. states (2024 estimates) [ 406 ] State Population (millions) California 39.4 Texas 31.3 Florida 23.4 New York 19.9 Pennsylvania 13.1 Illinois 12.7 Ohio 11.9 Georgia 11.2 North Carolina 11.0 Michigan 10.1 The U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents on April 1, 2020, [ s ] [ 407 ] making the United States the third-most-populous country in the world, after China and India. [ 180 ] The Census Bureau's official 2024 population estimate was 340,110,988, an increase of 2.6% since the 2020 census. [ 13 ] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock , on July 1, 2024, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 16 seconds, or about 5400 people per day. [ 408 ] In 2023, 51% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed , 10% were divorced, and 34% had never been married. [ 409 ] In 2023, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.6 children per woman, [ 410 ] and, at 23%, it had the world's highest rate of children living in single-parent households in 2019. [ 411 ] The United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members. [ 412 ] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population. [ 413 ] [ 414 ] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the country's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total U.S. population. [ 412 ] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population. The country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%, [ 412 ] and some 574 native tribes are recognized by the federal government. [ 415 ] In 2022, the median age of the United States population was 38.9 years. [ 416 ] Language Main article: Languages of the United States Most spoken languages in the U.S. While many languages are spoken in the United States, English is by far the most commonly spoken and written. [ 417 ] English was made the official language of the United States by Executive Order 14224 in 2025. [ 4 ] However, Congress has never passed a bill to designate English as the official language of all three federal branches. Some laws, such as U.S. naturalization requirements , nonetheless standardize English. Twenty-eight states and the United States Virgin Islands have declared English as the sole official language; 19 states and the District of Columbia have no official language. [ 418 ] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English: Hawaii ( Hawaiian ), [ 419 ] Alaska ( twenty Native languages ), [ t ] [ 420 ] South Dakota ( Sioux ), [ 421 ] American Samoa ( Samoan ), Puerto Rico ( Spanish ), Guam ( Chamorro ), and the Northern Mariana Islands ( Carolinian and Chamorro). In total, 169 Native American languages are spoken in the United States. [ 422 ] In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English. [ 423 ] According to the American Community Survey (2020), [ 424 ] some 245.4 million people in the U.S. age five and older spoke only English at home. About 41.2 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (3.40 million), Tagalog (1.71 million), Vietnamese (1.52 million), Arabic (1.39 million), French (1.18 million), Korean (1.07 million), and Russian (1.04 million). German , spoken by 1 million people at home in 2010, fell to 857,000 total speakers in 2020. [ 425 ] Immigration Main article: Immigration to the United States The Mexico–United States border wall between San Diego (left) and Tijuana (right) America's immigrant population is by far the world's largest in absolute terms . [ 426 ] [ 427 ] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population. [ 428 ] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants. [ 429 ] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%). [ 430 ] In fiscal year 2022, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification ) were granted legal residence . [ 431 ] In fiscal year 2024 alone, according to the Migration Policy Institute , the United States resettled 100,034 refugees, which ""re-cements the United States' role as the top global resettlement destination, far surpassing other major resettlement countries in Europe and Canada"". [ 432 ] Religion Main article: Religion in the United States Religious affiliation in the U.S., according to a 2023 Gallup poll: [ 9 ] Protestantism (33%) Catholicism (22%) Non-specific Christian (11%) Judaism (2%) Mormonism (1%) Other religion (6%) Unaffiliated (22%) Unanswered (3%) The First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion in the country and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment . [ 433 ] [ 434 ] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world, [ 435 ] and profoundly vibrant. [ 436 ] The country has the world's largest Christian population . [ 437 ] Other notable faiths include Judaism , Buddhism , Hinduism , Islam , many New Age movements, and Native American religions . [ 438 ] Religious practice varies significantly by region. [ 439 ] "" Ceremonial deism "" is common in American culture. [ 440 ] The overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power or spiritual force, engage in spiritual practices such as prayer, and consider themselves religious or spiritual . [ 441 ] [ 442 ] In the "" Bible Belt "", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally, whereas New England and the Western United States tend to be more secular . [ 439 ] [ 443 ] Mormonism —a Restorationist movement, whose members migrated westward from Missouri and Illinois under the leadership of Brigham Young in 1847 after the assassination of Joseph Smith [ 444 ] —remains the predominant religion in Utah to this day. Urbanization Main articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population About 82% of Americans live in urban areas , including suburbs; [ 180 ] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. [ 445 ] In 2022, 333 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities— New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston —had populations exceeding two million.

[ 449 ] [ 450 ] In 2018, it employed 120,000 people and treated 10 million patients. [ 451 ] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023 (75.8 years for men and 81.1 years for women). This was a gain of 0.9 year from 77.5 years in 2022, and the CDC noted that the new average was largely driven by ""decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer and diabetes"". [ 452 ] Starting in 1998, life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries , and Americans' ""health disadvantage"" gap has been increasing ever since. [ 453 ] The Commonwealth Fund reported in 2020 that the U.S. had the highest suicide rate among high-income countries . [ 454 ] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight. [ 455 ] The U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other country , measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer countries for reasons that are debated. [ 456 ] The United States is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare , and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance . [ 457 ] Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor ( Medicaid ) and for those age 65 and older ( Medicare ) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . [ u ] [ 458 ] Abortion in the United States is not federally protected, and is illegal or restricted in 17 states. [ 459 ] Education Main article: Education in the United States Some 77% of American college students attend public institutions [ 460 ] such as the University of Virginia , founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819. American primary and secondary education (known in the U.S. as K–12 , ""kindergarten through 12th grade"") is decentralized. School systems are operated by state, territorial, and sometimes municipal governments and regulated by the U.S. Department of Education . In general, children are required to attend school or an approved homeschool from the age of five or six ( kindergarten or first grade ) until they are 18 years old. This often brings students through the 12th grade , the final year of a U.S. high school, but some states and territories allow them to leave school earlier, at age 16 or 17. [ 461 ] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any other country, [ 462 ] an average of $18,614 per year per public elementary and secondary school student in 2020–2021. [ 463 ] Among Americans age 25 and older, 92.2% graduated from high school, 62.7% attended some college, 37.7% earned a bachelor's degree , and 14.2% earned a graduate degree. [ 464 ] The U.S. literacy rate is near-universal. [ 180 ] [ 465 ] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners of any country , with 411 (having won 413 awards). [ 466 ] [ 467 ] U.S. tertiary or higher education has earned a global reputation. Many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25. [ 468 ] [ 469 ] American higher education is dominated by state university systems , although the country's many private universities and colleges enroll about 20% of all American students. Local community colleges generally offer coursework and degree programs covering the first two years of college study. They often have more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. [ 470 ] As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and Americans spend more than all nations in combined public and private spending. [ 471 ] Colleges and universities directly funded by the federal government do not charge tuition and are limited to military personnel and government employees, including: the U.S. service academies , the Naval Postgraduate School , and military staff colleges . Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place, [ 472 ] student loan debt increased by 102% between 2010 and 2020, [ 473 ] and exceeded $1.7 trillion in 2022. [ 474 ] Culture and society Main articles: Culture of the United States , Society of the United States , and Human rights in the United States The Statue of Liberty ( Liberty Enlightening the World ) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream . [ 475 ] Americans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an "" American Creed "" emphasizing consent of the governed , liberty , equality under the law , democracy , social equality , property rights , and a preference for limited government . [ 476 ] [ 477 ] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy , [ 478 ] [ 479 ] as well as having a strong work ethic , [ 480 ] competitiveness , [ 481 ] and voluntary altruism towards others. [ 482 ] [ 483 ] [ 484 ] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation , Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity—the highest rate in the world by a large margin. [ 485 ] The United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values . [ 486 ] [ 487 ] The country has acquired significant hard and soft power through its diplomatic influence , economic power , military alliances , and cultural exports such as American movies , music , video games , sports , and food . [ 488 ] [ 489 ] The influence that the United States exerts on other countries through soft power is referred to as Americanization . [ 490 ] Nearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Europe, Africa, or Asia (the "" Old World "") within the past five centuries. [ 491 ] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa . [ 492 ] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot , and a heterogeneous salad bowl , with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture. The American Dream , or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility , plays a key role in attracting immigrants. [ 493 ] [ 494 ] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate. [ 495 ] [ 496 ] [ 497 ] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society , [ 498 ] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes , affecting socialization , language, and values. [ 499 ] [ 500 ] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well. [ 501 ] The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities is an agency of the United States federal government that was established in 1965 with the purpose to ""develop and promote a broadly conceived national policy of support for the humanities and the arts in the United States, and for institutions which preserve the cultural heritage of the United States."" [ 502 ] It is composed of four sub-agencies: National Endowment for the Arts National Endowment for the Humanities Institute of Museum and Library Services Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities The United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment , [ 503 ] which protects flag desecration , hate speech , blasphemy , and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression. [ 504 ] [ 505 ] [ 506 ] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured. [ 507 ] They are the ""most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship"". [ 508 ] The U.S. is a socially progressive country [ 509 ] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality . [ 510 ] LGBT rights in the United States are advanced by global standards. [ 510 ] [ 511 ] [ 512 ] Literature Main articles: American literature and American philosophy Mark Twain , whom William Faulkner called ""the father of American literature"" [ 513 ] Colonial American authors were influenced by John Locke and various other Enlightenment philosophers. [ 514 ] [ 515 ] The American Revolutionary Period (1765–1783) is notable for the political writings of Benjamin Franklin , Alexander Hamilton , Thomas Paine , and Thomas Jefferson . Shortly before and after the Revolutionary War , the newspaper rose to prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national literature. [ 516 ] [ 517 ] An early novel is William Hill Brown 's The Power of Sympathy , published in 1791. Writer and critic John Neal in the early- to mid-nineteenth century helped advance America toward a unique literature and culture by criticizing predecessors such as Washington Irving for imitating their British counterparts, and by influencing writers such as Edgar Allan Poe , [ 518 ] who took American poetry and short fiction in new directions. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller pioneered the influential Transcendentalism movement; [ 519 ] [ 520 ] Henry David Thoreau , author of Walden , was influenced by this movement. The conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired writers, like Harriet Beecher Stowe , and authors of slave narratives, such as Frederick Douglass . Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter (1850) explored the dark side of American history, as did Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick (1851). Major American poets of the nineteenth century American Renaissance include Walt Whitman , Melville, and Emily Dickinson . [ 521 ] [ 522 ] Mark Twain was the first major American writer to be born in the West. Henry James achieved international recognition with novels like The Portrait of a Lady (1881). As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered around industrial workers, women, and the rural poor. [ 523 ] [ 524 ] Naturalism , regionalism , and realism were the major literary movements of the period. [ 525 ] [ 526 ] While modernism generally took on an international character, modernist authors working within the United States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and cultures. [ 527 ] Following the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black West Indian authors of the Harlem Renaissance developed an independent tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the Jazz Age , these writings were a key influence on Négritude , a philosophy emerging in the 1930s among francophone writers of the African diaspora . [ 528 ] [ 529 ] In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel , [ 530 ] while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society. [ 531 ] [ 532 ] Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language . [ 533 ] Twelve American laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Literature . [ 534 ] Mass media Main article: Mass media in the United States See also: Newspapers in the United States , Television in the United States , Broadcasting in the United States , Public broadcasting in the United States , Internet in the United States , Radio in the United States , and Video games in the United States Comcast Center in Philadelphia , headquarters of Comcast , one of the world's largest telecommunications companies and media conglomerates Media in the United States is broadly uncensored , with the First Amendment providing significant protections, as reiterated in New York Times Co. v. United States . [ 503 ] The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches. [ 535 ] In 2021, about 83% of Americans over age 12 listened to broadcast radio , while about 40% listened to podcasts . [ 536 ] In the prior year, there were 15,460 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). [ 537 ] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR , incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 . [ 538 ] U.S. newspapers with a global reach and reputation include The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , The Washington Post , and USA Today . [ 539 ] About 800 publications are produced in Spanish. [ 540 ] [ 541 ] With few exceptions, newspapers are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy , which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in an increasingly rare situation, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as The Village Voice in New York City and LA Weekly in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google , YouTube , Amazon , Yahoo , and Facebook —all of them American-owned. [ 542 ] In 2022, the video game market of the United States was the world's largest by revenue . [ 543 ] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone. [ 544 ] Theater Main article: Theater in the United States Broadway theaters in Theater District, Manhattan The United States is well known for its theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater . [ 545 ] By the middle of the 19th century America had created new distinct dramatic forms in the Tom Shows , the showboat theater and the minstrel show . [ 546 ] The central hub of the American theater scene is the Theater District in Manhattan , with its divisions of Broadway , off-Broadway , and off-off-Broadway . [ 547 ] Many movie and television celebrities have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theat"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States,"ff-Broadway . [ 547 ] Many movie and television celebrities have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture. [ 548 ] The Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theater and are presented at an annual ceremony in Manhattan . The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theater . Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award , the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre , and the Isabelle Stevenson Award . [ 549 ] Visual arts Main articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States American Gothic (1930) by Grant Wood is one of the most famous American paintings and is widely parodied . [ 550 ] Folk art in colonial America grew out of artisanal craftsmanship in communities that allowed commonly trained people to individually express themselves. It was distinct from Europe's tradition of high art , which was less accessible and generally less relevant to early American settlers. [ 551 ] Cultural movements in art and craftsmanship in colonial America generally lagged behind those of Western Europe. For example, the prevailing medieval style of woodworking and primitive sculpture became integral to early American folk art, despite the emergence of Renaissance styles in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The new English styles would have been early enough to make a considerable impact on American folk art, but American styles and forms had already been firmly adopted. Not only did styles change slowly in early America, but there was a tendency for rural artisans there to continue their traditional forms longer than their urban counterparts did—and far longer than those in Western Europe. [ 503 ] The Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the visual arts tradition of European naturalism . The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art , shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. [ 552 ] American Realism and American Regionalism sought to reflect and give America new ways of looking at itself. Georgia O'Keeffe , Marsden Hartley , and others experimented with new and individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism . Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz , Edward Steichen , Dorothea Lange , Edward Weston , James Van Der Zee , Ansel Adams , and Gordon Parks . [ 553 ] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright , Philip Johnson , and Frank Gehry . [ 554 ] The Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan is the largest art museum in the United States [ 555 ] and the fourth-largest in the world. [ 556 ] Music Main article: Music of the United States The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee American folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music , contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles , mainland Europe , or Africa . [ 557 ] The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music in particular have influenced American music. [ 558 ] Banjos were brought to America through the slave trade. Minstrel shows incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased popularity and widespread production in the 19th century. [ 559 ] [ 560 ] The electric guitar , first invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of rock and roll . [ 561 ] The synthesizer , turntablism , and electronic music were also largely developed in the U.S. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton . Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century. [ 562 ] Country music developed in the 1920s, [ 563 ] rock and roll in the 1930s, [ 561 ] and bluegrass [ 564 ] and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. [ 565 ] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters. [ 566 ] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States in the 1970s. [ 567 ] The United States has the world's largest music market , with a total retail value of $15.9 billion in 2022. [ 568 ] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). [ 569 ] Mid-20th-century American pop stars, such as Frank Sinatra [ 570 ] and Elvis Presley , [ 571 ] became global celebrities and best-selling music artists , [ 562 ] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Michael Jackson , [ 572 ] Madonna , [ 573 ] Whitney Houston , [ 574 ] and Mariah Carey , [ 575 ] and the early 21st century, such as Eminem , [ 576 ] Britney Spears , [ 577 ] Lady Gaga , [ 577 ] Katy Perry , [ 577 ] Taylor Swift and Beyoncé . [ 578 ] Fashion Main article: Fashion in the United States Haute couture fashion models on the catwalk during New York Fashion Week The United States has the world's largest apparel market by revenue. [ 579 ] Apart from professional business attire , American fashion is eclectic and predominantly informal. Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing; however, sneakers , jeans , T-shirts , and baseball caps are emblematic of American styles. [ 580 ] New York, with its fashion week , is considered to be one of the ""Big Four"" global fashion capitals , along with Paris , Milan , and London . A study demonstrated that general proximity to Manhattan's Garment District has been synonymous with American fashion since its inception in the early 20th century. [ 581 ] The headquarters of many designer labels reside in Manhattan . Labels cater to niche markets , such as preteens. New York Fashion Week is one of the most influential fashion weeks in the world, and occurs twice a year; [ 582 ] while the annual Met Gala in Manhattan is commonly known as the fashion world's ""biggest night"". [ 583 ] [ 584 ] Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United States The iconic Hollywood Sign in the Hollywood Hills , often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry The U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following . Hollywood , a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is also metonymous for the American filmmaking industry. [ 585 ] [ 586 ] [ 587 ] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world. [ 588 ] [ 589 ] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization. [ 590 ] The Academy Awards , popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929, [ 591 ] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944. [ 592 ] The industry peaked in what is commonly referred to as the "" Golden Age of Hollywood "", from the early sound period until the early 1960s, [ 593 ] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures. [ 594 ] [ 595 ] In the 1970s, "" New Hollywood "", or the ""Hollywood Renaissance"", [ 596 ] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period . [ 597 ] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema. [ 598 ] [ 599 ] Cuisine Main article: American cuisine A Thanksgiving dinner with roast turkey , mashed potatoes , pickles , corn , candied yams , cranberry jelly , shrimps , stuffing , green peas , deviled eggs , green salad , and apple sauce Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to foods such as turkey , sweet potatoes , corn , squash , and maple syrup . Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash . Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour , [ 600 ] beef, and milk, to create a distinctive American cuisine. [ 601 ] [ 602 ] New World crops , especially pumpkin , corn, potatoes , and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving , when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion. [ 603 ] Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie , fried chicken , doughnuts , french fries , macaroni and cheese , ice cream , hamburgers , hot dogs , and American pizza derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups. [ 604 ] [ 605 ] [ 606 ] [ 607 ] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed. [ 608 ] American chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth . This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers. [ 609 ] [ 610 ] The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020, [ 611 ] [ 612 ] and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly. [ 611 ] It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall. [ 613 ] [ 614 ] The United States is home to over 220 Michelin star -rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone. [ 615 ] Wine has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico in 1628. [ 616 ] [ 617 ] [ 618 ] In the modern U.S., wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all U.S. wine . With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500 km 2 ) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine-producing country in the world, after Italy , Spain , and France . [ 619 ] [ 620 ] The American fast-food industry developed alongside the nation's car culture . [ 621 ] American restaurants developed the drive-in format in the 1920s, which they began to replace with the drive-through format by the 1940s. [ 622 ] [ 623 ] American fast-food restaurant chains, such as McDonald's , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Dunkin' Donuts and many others , have numerous outlets around the world. [ 624 ] Sports Main articles: Sports in the United States and United States at the Olympics American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this 2009 National Football League game, Carolina Panthers quarterback Jake Delhomme (number 17) throws a forward pass against the Dallas Cowboys . The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football , basketball , baseball , soccer , and ice hockey . [ 625 ] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball , skateboarding , and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide. [ 626 ] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact. [ 627 ] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined. [ 628 ] American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States; [ 629 ] the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally. [ 630 ] However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. "" national sport "" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the National Basketball Association , Major League Baseball , Major League Soccer , and the National Hockey League . The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing , particularly NASCAR and IndyCar . [ 631 ] [ 632 ] On the collegiate level , earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually, [ 633 ] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA March Madness tournament and the College Football Playoff are some of the most watched national sporting events. [ 634 ] In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system for professional sports. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function. [ 635 ] Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri , were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe. [ 636 ] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics . U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,968 medals (1,179 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country. [ 637 ] [ 638 ] [ 639 ] In international professional competition, the U.S. men's national soccer team has qualified for eleven World Cups , while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each. [ 640 ] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup . [ 641 ] The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was also hosted by the United States. Its final match was watched by 90,185, setting the world record for most-attended women's sporting event at the time.

As with the Beer Hall Putsch, a would-be leader tried to take advantage of an already scheduled event (in Hitler's case, Kahr's speech; in Trump's, Congress's tallying of the electoral votes) to create a dramatic moment with himself at the center of attention, calling for bold action to upend the political order. Unlike Hitler's coup attempt, Trump already held top of office, so he was attempting to hold onto power, not seize it (the precise term for Trump's intended action is a 'self-coup' or 'autogolpe'). Thus, Trump was able to plan for the event well in advance, and with much greater control, including developing the legal arguments that could be used to justify rejecting the election's results.

What the United States went through on January 6th was an attempt at a self-coup, where Trump would use force to stay as head of state even if abandoning democratic practices in the U.S. Some advised Trump to declare martial law to create a state of emergency and use that as an excuse to stay in power.

Brookings Institution . Retrieved December 16, 2023 . [Trump] tried to delegitimize the election results by disseminating a series of far fetched and evidence-free claims of fraud. Meanwhile, with a ring of close confidants, Trump conceived and implemented unprecedented schemes to – in his own words – ""overturn"" the election outcome. Among the results of this ""Big Lie"" campaign were the terrible events of January 6, 2021 – an inflection point in what we now understand was nothing less than an attempted coup. Eastman v Thompson, et al. , 8:22-cv-00099-DOC-DFM Document 260 , 44 (S.D. Cal. May 28, 2022) (""Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history. Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower – it was a coup in search of a legal theory. The plan spurred violent attacks on the seat of our nation's government, led to the deaths of several law enforcement officers, and deepened public distrust in our political process... If Dr. Eastman and President Trump's plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.""). Graham, David A. (January 6, 2021).

PIEZO ENERGY TILES: While the Nation is facing a great challenge to meet the requirement of electric power in various spheres of daily life due to multiplying growth of population, the students of Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College Ghaziabad have found the solution of growing teathing problem of electric power generation. The innovative idea conceptualized by these young engineers utilizes each step of growing population for generation of electric power. The growing population which was considered a cause for depletion will soon become a source of generation to meet the growing demand of electric power. The students of B.Tech (Mechanical) of AKGEC have conceptualized, designed and fabricated an “Energy Tile” which produces electric power with each step on it. The “Energy Tile” has been functionally tested for its purpose and also demonstrated at Metro Bhawan for its wide spread use at various metro stations of DMRC. The “Energy Tile” will find its use at Airports, Shopping Malls. Hospitals, Bus Stands, concerts and at any place where frequent movements of crowding population takes place. The innovative efforts by the young engineers of AKGEC are an inspiring step towards Skill India & Make in India.

The society is formed with an aim to provide a platform to the students on which they enhance their practical knowledge and gain valuable experience in the industrial arena. Samveg Society aims to help students turn their imagination into an engineering reality and supports all the imagination processes through creative events from its inception to final creation. Samveg acts as a platform for all mechanical students to show their technical and managerial skills and improve on them. Students of the college are offered opportunities such as quizzing, debating, group discussions, industrial visits, technical conferences and various technical events. Samveg has actively participated as a society in various Technical Festivals over the years. The sole intention behind starting off with a department society was to provide a channelized growth medium to the students, not merely in the field of academics, but also for other extra-curricular activities. Junkyard'22 was organized by Samveg, the society of Mechanical engineers, to select the best team who will go to AKTU Zonal to represent the college in techfest. It was a two-day event which had participation of more than 50 teams being judged for their creativity and innovative abilities with the tasks and games. First day had some innovative games and tasks from which only top 30 teams were selected for the Day 2 of Junkyard. The next day, top teams gathered along with their innovative thinking, creative abilities and team co-ordination to create useful products from the scraps and junks provided to them. Based on what they made, the innovation behind it, all the concepts, workings of their model and their implementation in real world, our judges picked the Best three teams from which the first-place holder, Team Alpha won and got set to represent AKGEC at Zonal.

Samveg has actively participated as a society in various Technical Festivals over the years. The sole intention behind starting off with a department society was to provide a channelized growth medium to the students, not merely in the field of academics, but also for other extra-curricular activities. In 2006-07, the Society started by organising six major events in the Techfest held on 16th and 17th October 2006. The events organised for the first time were Bob the Builder, Gears to puzzle you, Robo Race, Junk Yard, Workshop Modelling and Paper Presentation. Robo Race and Junk Yard was amongst the most popular technical events in the history of college. In the subsequent years, new events like “The Sea Legacy"" and “The Wrath of Wings"" were added and few events were modified such as Robo Race is modified to Rob Soccer. Maintaining its trend of enhancing technical skills and sharpening young minds, SAMVEG kept its journey on by conducting atleast two events in every academic year independently such as Table Stable, Bridge it… Fix it, World without Engineering, Student of the Year, Roadsters, Boreas' Battle amongst others. Samveg students organized a college level conference “Tomorrow’s India” on 11 Oct 2015 under the guidance of Prof. I.P. Sharma, HoD, ME, and Mr. Pallab Biswas, Faculty Advisor –Samveg. Samveg Society Students on 27th September, 2014 under the guidance of Prof. I.P. Sharma, HoD, ME, and Mr. Pallab Biswas , Faculty Advisor -Samveg, organised CoMEGT – the Conference on Mechanical Engineering in Green Technologies. This was the first ever students’ conference held in our college . The motive of the conference was to promote green technology, which is the need of the hour as it drastically helps keep the environment greener by reducing carbon footprints. This conference was conducted zealously. The work was well organized and effectively distributed. The main objective was to inculcate the idea of green technology amongst college students by the medium of conference where they got an interactive platform for presenting their views on latest innovations in the field of green technology. Another objective of this conference was to develop a professional environment in our college which was successfully achieved by developing the presentation skills of a large number of students during the course of the event and also develop research acumen in them. The event was concluded in following four phases: Synopses submission and short listing Seminar on techniques for giving good presentation Mentorship program for finalists Conference The conference proved to be an interactive platform where all the participants, the judges and the audience participated in an integrated manner to promote and share the knowledge of green technology, “a boon to the present era” . In 2016-17, Students of SAMVEG Society were actively involved in organizing and coordination of society activities. The Samveg students organized the events QUADMANIA, QUIZENE and AUTOCAD TRAINING during the academic year. SAMVEG students of Mechanical Engineering department were actively involved in organizing and coordination of society activities. The Samveg students have organized the events ROBOTRIX 17 on 11-12 Feb 2017 and BLITZKRIEG on 5-6 Apr 2017 during even semester 2017-18.

From designing the dresses and props to choreographing the show and preparing the soundtrack, we do it all, without any outside help and everything is done exclusively on the basis of the theme. And in the end, our models sizzle the ramp with their confidence and glamour. Our shows are more than just a strut in stilettos. We do not talk, we do not act and yet our shows shout out to the audiences about social issues like Drug abuse, depression, women empowerment, LGBT etc. V-Verve will appeal to anyone with an interest in fashion whether it be designing, modelling, photography or simply a love for creativity.

Visit of Volleyball Team to Malviya National Institute of technology (MNIT, Jaipur) An Eight-member volleyball team of our college from B. tech 3rd and 4th year participated in Malviya sports Tournament 2023 held at MNIT, Jaipur w.e.f. 23/3/23 to 25/3/23. The tournament was inaugurated by Shri Ram Kumar Sehrawat a former Indian basketball player and coach of junior Indian team as Chief Guest. It was a proud moment that we were selected to participate as one among ten teams from various prestigious Institutes. The ten teams were divided on four pools and the matches were held on league cum knockout basis. Our first league match was held with University College of Engineering and Technology (UCET, Bikaner) who were the champions of last year’s Malviya Sports Tournament. So, we were pitted against a very strong team, However, we played well and to the best of our ability but lost by a close margin in a best of 3 games with the score being 25(AKGEC)-27(UCET) in the first set and 23(AKGEC)-25(UCET) in the second set. As four of our very good players from B. tech 2nd year could not join because of their End Semester University Exams, the result would have been different and in all probability a victory in our favour. The Second league match was to be played against NIT, Uttarakhand who did not turn up and we got a “walkover” victory. As a result, we were declared runners up of our pool. However, overall championship of the game was won by MNIT, Jaipur with UCET, Bikaner as the runners up. We are very thankful to our director Dr. R.K. Agarwal for allowing us to participate in this prestigious tournament. We are also thankful to our DSW Prof. V.K. Parashar and Sports Officer Mr. Pratap Singh for supporting as well as motivating us to participate in the tournament. This tournament provided us with new experience and strategies to work on our sport which will help us to perform better in the upcoming AKTU zonal and states tournament.
