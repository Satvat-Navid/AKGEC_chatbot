# Faith Centre
The well known beauty of Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad gets further enhanced with the existence of college Faith Centre. The Faith Centre of the college is built in a manner to deliver a spiritually evocative space and to accommodate its faculty, staff and students. The calm ambience of the faith centre acts as enabler to generate peace of mind and concentrate on spiritual and moral well being. It has a beautifully designed hall in the centre surrounded by well maintained lawn and fountains. The faith centre is dedicated to “Maa Saraswati” commonly known as “Goddess of knowledge”. A beautiful approx six feet high idol of “Maa Saraswati” made up of white marble, gives a feel of liveliness. The Dome of faith centre is architecturally similar to Lotus Temple of Delhi. The sprinkling fountains on the outer periphery of the Dome, make it more lively. The Faith Centre is the heart and soul of AKGEC campus where an AKGECian can visit and witness the nature creativity.

# Policy and Process for Refund of Caution Money
The caution money and security deposit are refundable after deduction of dues, if any, only after the student finally leaves the College on completion of the course.
Each student, studying in the final year of his/her course, is required to fill up clearance form (No Dues Form) and submit the same to the Accounts Office, before leaving the College. The Accounts Office processes the forms and distributes the cheques of caution money at the time of College Convocation. For this the students are individually informed through letters and e-mails. Majority of the caution money cheques are distributed in one go in a single day through the aforesaid process. Those students who fail to attend the Convocation Ceremony may collect their cheques on any other working day during College hours.

### [](https://www.akgec.ac.in/achievements/student-awards-extra-curricular/#visit-of-volleyball-team-to-malviya-national-institute-of-technology-mnit-jaipur)
An Eight-member volleyball team of our college from B. tech 3rd and 4th year participated in Malviya sports Tournament 2023 held at MNIT, Jaipur w.e.f. 23/3/23 to 25/3/23. The tournament was inaugurated by Shri Ram Kumar Sehrawat a former Indian basketball player and coach of junior Indian team as Chief Guest.
It was a proud moment that we were selected to participate as one among ten teams from various prestigious Institutes. The ten teams were divided on four pools and the matches were held on league cum knockout basis.
Our first league match was held with University College of Engineering and Technology (UCET, Bikaner) who were the champions of last year’s Malviya Sports Tournament. So, we were pitted against a very strong team, However, we played well and to the best of our ability but lost by a close margin in a best of 3 games with the score being 25(AKGEC)-27(UCET) in the first set and 23(AKGEC)-25(UCET) in the second set. As four of our very good players from B. tech 2nd year could not join because of their End Semester University Exams, the result would have been different and in all probability a victory in our favour.
The Second league match was to be played against NIT, Uttarakhand who did not turn up and we got a “walkover” victory. As a result, we were declared runners up of our pool. However, overall championship of the game was won by MNIT, Jaipur with UCET, Bikaner as the runners up.
We are very thankful to our director Dr. R.K. Agarwal for allowing us to participate in this prestigious tournament. We are also thankful to our DSW Prof. V.K. Parashar and Sports Officer Mr. Pratap Singh for supporting as well as motivating us to participate in the tournament. This tournament provided us with new experience and strategies to work on our sport which will help us to perform better in the upcoming AKTU zonal and states tournament.

One of the strengths of AKGEC is, and has always been, its alumni. To establish, maintain and nurture a sustained, lifelong, and mutually beneficial relationship with its alumni, AKGEC formed an Alumni Association in 2005. Since its formation, the college has been actively involved in facilitating networking amongst alumni for social and professional synergy. AKGEC organized its first annual alumni meet on 02 April, 2005.
Keeping with the tradition, this year too, the alumni association has successfully organized the 16th Alumni Meet on 18th March 2023. The alumni meet was organised in the Vedanta farms, adjoining the college campus. The meet was marked by the presence of around 400 alumni from 2002 to 2022 batches. Many Alumni attended with families.
The meet started with welcoming the alumni and their families. Alumni participated in different party games like Tambola, Baloon Bursting, Musical Chair etc. During the meet, the Director General, HoDs, Section In-charges and Faculty members informally interacted with the alumni, in which they shared their success stories, experiences and plans for the future.
The event concluded with a Lucky Draw and flash mob followed by Dinner. The alumni departed with a promise to remain in touch with the Institute through various activities and to meet again in 2024.

One of the strengths of AKGEC is, and has always been, its alumni. To establish, maintain and nurture a sustained, lifelong, and mutually beneficial relationship with its alumni, AKGEC formed an Alumni Association in 2005. Since its formation, the college has been actively involved in facilitating networking amongst alumni for social and professional synergy. AKGEC organized its first annual alumni meet on 02 April, 2005.
Keeping with the tradition, this year too, the alumni association has successfully organized the 15th Alumni Meet on 16th March 2019. The alumni meet was conducted in the Vedanta farms, adjoining the college campus. The meet was marked by the presence of around 250 alumni from 2002 to 2018 batches. Many Alumni visited with families.
The meet started with welcoming the alumni and their families. Alumni participated in different party games like Tambola, Baloon Bursting, Musical Chair etc. During the meet, the Director, HoDs, Section In-charges and Faculty members informally interacted with the alumni, in which they shared their success stories, experiences and plans for the future.
The event concluded with a Lucky Draw and flash mob followed by Dinner. The alumni departed with a promise to remain in touch with the Institute through various activities and to meet again in 2020.

“The rhythm of tradition in the psalm of life,   
Enriched with festivity, love and elation,  
We witness the artistry of this wondrous night,  
Rising to an epitome of cheerful celebration."
Garba, a breath-taking extravaganza, a plethora of colors and an emblem of grandeur that culminates the monotony of everyday life, is celebrated as an annual hostel event – a shimmery evening of togetherness and festivity with an expression of gratitude to the faculty members from students and a reverent laudation to the seniors passing out.
This year also Garba was celebrated on 27 September, 2018 with the theme ABHIJISHYA, meaning strong and independent women and it was proved by the enthusiasm and humongous participation by the girls leading to the success of this beautiful and elegant event.
The bang on performances of our beauty with brains that is fourth year girls competing for the titles of Ms. Garba and Ms. Personality were cherished by all and offered a tough task for the senior faculty as judges to evaluate them. At last Shagun Singh and Vartika Raj won the title of Ms. Garba and Ms. Personality respectively.

AKGEC celebrated the nation’s 75th Independence day on 15 August, 2021. Director General, Dr. R.K. Agarwal, hoisted the National Flag in the presence of Heads of Departments, Deans, faculty and staff. In his address to the audience, Dr. Agarwal stated that the Independence Day reminds every Indian about the dawn of a new beginning, the beginning of an era of liberation from the oppression during the British Raj of more than 200 years. It is the day to remember and pay homage to the martyrs, revolutionaries and freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives so that we, the future generations, could live, grow and prosper in a free nation. It is also the day for us to dedicate ourselves to the service of our nation and work towards fulfilling their aspirations and dreams of a peaceful, developed, prosperous and happy nation. He stressed that all we need to do is to do our work/ duties with utmost sincerity, be a law abiding conscientious citizen and a good human being with sound ethics, moral values, positive attitude and concern for others.
In view of the Covid 19 pandemic, the celebrations were constrained under the norms of social distancing.
Distribution of sweets amidst the playing of patriotic songs marked the end of the celebrations.

### [](https://www.akgec.ac.in/life-akgec/events/festival-celebrations/yoga-day/#international-yoga-day-2021)
The International Yoga Day is celebrated on June 21 every year to spread awareness about the important health benefits of practising yoga since 2015.
Yoga not only provides physical and mental relaxation but also develops strength and resilience. The numerous benefits of Yoga make it a popular practice for people across the globe, especially in times of a pandemic when mental and physical health is under stress. Beyond its immediate impact on physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated psychological suffering and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, due to the pandemic-related restrictions and its after effects.
The message of Yoga in promoting both the physical and mental well-being of humanity has never been more relevant. A growing trend of people around the world embracing Yoga to stay healthy and rejuvenated and to fight social isolation and depression has been witnessed during the pandemic. Yoga is also playing a significant role in the psycho-social care and rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients in quarantine and isolation. It is particularly helpful in allaying their fears and anxiety.
Recognizing this important role of Yoga, the commemoration of the International Day of Yoga in 2021 focused on “Yoga for well-being” – how the practice of Yoga can promote the holistic health of every individual.
Like the year 2020, faculty and staff of AKGEC practiced Yoga at home with their families and shared their pictures with the College. Colonel M.K. Pandey, Retired, guided the faculty and staff through the yogasans online.

Based on the proposal by our great Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, during his first address to the UN general assembly, and realizing the importance of yoga practices in maintaining mental and physical wellbeing, United Nations declared 21 June as International Yoga Day on 11Dec 2014. The objective of this day is to be sensitize and remind people across the globe about the benefits of yoga. Since then our college has been observing the Yoga Day every year by organizing Yoga sessions for faculty, staff and students. College has also been organizing yoga sessions for the benefit of faculty and staff during June and July and for the students during the Orientation period.
On account of the Covid 19 pandemic, the college advised all its members to celebrate the Yoga Day safely from home along with their family members on 21 June, 2020.

Apart from academics, the college also pays equal concern over the physical development of the students, and in the spirit of the game the college organized **INTER DEPARTMENTAL SPORTS EVENTS** that spanned over two months. The events witnessed a massive participation of more than 2000 students in about 24 different sporting events. A total of 256 matches were played during the course of the sports meet.
All the matches were efficiently managed and were played in the spirit of the game. Some of the matches witnessed nail-biting finishes which reflected the resolve of every contingent and further added to the charm of the sports meet. The events also saw a massive participation from the audience as large crowd ad loud cheers during every match became the spectacle of the sports meet and defined its success in many sort.
The closing ceremony was started by the release of balloon that followed by a massive performance by the dance society **Taal** to celebrate the free spirit and inculcate zeal and enthusiasm amongst everyone. The spectators were further mesmerized by the performance of the college band **Euphony**. The closing day witnessed the 100m dash (boys and girls) which was followed by the final game of Tug Of War between EN and ME which was won by EN. After that a friendly Tug Of War match between faculty members added to the colors of the day.
All the sports and athletics events were keenly contested by all the departments/contingent of the college. The championship trophy was successfully defended by the Department of Computer Science in a bottleneck competition with the Department of Mechanical Engineering wherein the result was decided on the ultimate day. The final tally of the points this year was as follows:
**Branch** |  **Gold** |  **Silver** |  **Bronze** |  **Points**  
---|---|---|---|---  
CSE  |  13  |  11  |  4  |  109   
ME  |  12  |  10  |  9  |  106   
IT  |  10  |  11  |  5  |  90

Towards the end, **Dr. R.K. Agarwal** shared his words of wisdom with the students appreciating their enthusiasm to participate in sports events and adapting the wise adage “Healthy body is the key to healthy mind.” Thereafter, **Prof. V.K.

# Eco Friendly Environment
The basic philosophy of AKGEC towards all processes and activities is oriented towards environmental sustenance and eco friendliness. The architecture, design and construction of college building is such that bricks and stones are used maximum and cement plastering is minimal which makes it maintenance free. The architecture of buildings ensures maximum sunlight on all floors. This allows high circulation of natural air and green plantations to flourish inside and outside buildings. The buildings are thermally insulated which keeps the temperature lower in summers and higher in winters, thereby reducing the need for power consumption.
Each block and building is surrounded by large open areas on which green lawns, hedges and planters maintain a healthy balance with environment.
A network of rain harvesting systems ensure continuous recharging of ground water table. The sewage treatment plant recycles the water filtered through its beds for use of horticulture, green lawns, hedges and plantations of college.
There is high focus on conservation of natural resources. Automatic water dispensers are used in toilets / urinals to avoid continuous running of water and ensure its usage when needed.
> Conservation of electricity is ensured by its usage only when and where needed. Slowly a culture has been built amongst faculty and staff to put off appliances, lights and fans when they leave office. Conservation of electricity is also ensured by use of solar water heaters for providing hot water in all the 6 hostels of the college. A roof top solar power plant of 330 KW capacity has been installed in college campus. This power plant is linked with the electric grid of electricity department where surplus power generated is fed back through a meter installed for this purpose.
Conservation of fossil fuels is ensured by making special efforts to co-ordinate and club various trips of vehicles required by different departments and their usage optimised.
The waste management area is given high priority. The recyclable garbage waste and non recyclable wastes are dumped in specified containers / dustbins. A separate agency with specialised expertise and dealing in waste collection and disposal has been hired to collect the wastes on daily basis. This company processes the bi-degradable waste to make manure and dispose off cyclable & non-cyclable wastes as per established norms of Government.
_**“Optimum usage of natural resources used by mankind is the  
basic need of the day to maintain required balance in nature  
This theme is our mantra."**_

# Nature Club
In view of the increasing problems of global warming, deforestation, ozone layer depletion, pollution and many more due to modern development, it is believed globally that the awareness about the present status of the environment to sensitize people about the inherent relationships with Nature has become very important.
With the above objective, Value Education Cell, AKGEC has established ‘Nature Club’ which is committed not only to spreading awareness about the problems but also to motivate students to find solutions to the problems in the light of inherent relationships. The effort will improve the competence of students to contribute towards the sustainability of nature and avoid environmental degradation in their individual capacity as well as in groups.
The club organized the event VASUDHA-2K19 during 15-19 April, 2019. During the event various competitions like Poster Making and Creative Ideas on enrichment, protection and right utilization of nature and Best Out of Waste were organized. The club celebrated International Earth Day on 22 April, 2019.

**“Nirmaan, its not only about construction, its a creation!"**
**Nirmaan, the society of Civil Engineers of Akgec,** is fully functional since the even semesters of 2014-15. Nirmaan came into existence purposefully, it was and it always will be to enhance the all-round development of the students, not only in academics but also practically and socially!
The on-field knowledge is a must for the students of Civil Engineering domain and we help them with the same. We have a counsel of some extremely qualified faculty and the guidance of our society seniors to help and motivate you to think, act and build!
> **“A building is not just a mere construction of bricks, its a beautiful painting carved with utter hardwork and passion of a civil engineer." And here, we start with our first step in the game!**
The society has active involvement in national level paper presentation college event, 'SCROLLS', deciding the topics for the civil domain in Scrolls. The society also contributes in the college Tech-fests. We recently organised TECHNOSPARX, an event based on the interests of students in technical as well as creative fields.
The society recently organised 'ANANT-SETU', a bridge-making competetion open for all, from first year to the final year students. With active involvement of our members and the support of seniors, it proved to be a successful one.
The society, in future, plans to conduct various workshops on AutoCAD and STADD Pro and involve ourselves in various projects.
> **The society has been assigned under Mr. Atri Tyagi , Assistant Professor, Civil Department. Also, we actively participate in several events organised by colleges like ABES, JSS, IMS and KIET Ghaziabad.**
With the completion of eighth semester and vacancies left behind by final year students, we recruit students every year from the Civil Branch only.
Be a part of the society, have the best-in-class guidance of the seniors, learn and you will definitely be having a lasting experience!
**Aao kuchh kaam karein,Aao Nirmaan karein..**

Phoenix, the student society associated with the department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, was formed on 20th September, 2005 by a group of six motivated students of batch 2006. The society formed with an aim to provide a platform to the students on which they enhance their practical knowledge and gain valuable experience in the industrial arena. The society aimed at conducting technical seminars by eminent personalities, workshops on various technical developments and organizing various technical events for the students in the college.
The first event that took place was Electronics Quiz. After that the society has conducted various events on regular basis. The society is continuously increasing its work force year by year. It has been providing to the students a positive gradient.
In 2006-07, the major hits were the Rover, Radix and the Instant Khichari held at the intra-college tech fest “TECH@VIBRATIONS’06" and the strength of society increased to 28 volunteers and co-ordinators. In 2007-08, the robotics event “Robonoid" organised by the society in “TECH TRISHNA'08"- was the most popular technical event in the history of college.
Maintaining its trend of enhancing technical skills and sharpening young minds, Phoenix kept its journey on by conducting 'Ecrire de conquirer'- an online technical article writing competition. The articles with the maximum likes were rewarded. As always the event On Board Quiz was a big hit. The event VIBEQUP-“Visual Buzzing and Entertaining Quiz of Puzzles was admired by all attracting intense participation. The final round held at amphitheatre gave an all way round fun and frolic entertainment to all with its multi-layered process.
In February’ 13, Phoenix family welcomed new faces and the strength reached a total of 45. Together with Samveg and Oorja, Phoenix conducted Robotrix classes to give a fundamental understanding of basic concepts involved in designing a robot. Keeping its statistics consistent – Robofestinate, organised during tech trishna'13 was again a great success. The other events organised during tech fest were Identomyst and Series parallel, which were equally appreciated and included mind tickling questions based on basic electrical and electronics engineering.

SAMVEG, the student society associated with the department of Mechanical Engineering, was formed on 1st March, 2006 under the guidance of Mr. Pallab Biswas and with the relentless support of the then third year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department. The society is formed with an aim to provide a platform to the students on which they enhance their practical knowledge and gain valuable experience in the industrial arena.
Samveg Society aims to help students turn their imagination into an engineering reality and supports all the imagination processes through creative events from its inception to final creation. Samveg acts as a platform for all mechanical students to show their technical and managerial skills and improve on them. Students of the college are offered opportunities such as quizzing, debating, group discussions, industrial visits, technical conferences and various technical events. Samveg has actively participated as a society in various Technical Festivals over the years. The sole intention behind starting off with a department society was to provide a channelized growth medium to the students, not merely in the field of academics, but also for other extra-curricular activities.
Junkyard'22 was organized by Samveg, the society of Mechanical engineers, to select the best team who will go to AKTU Zonal to represent the college in techfest.
It was a two-day event which had participation of more than 50 teams being judged for their creativity and innovative abilities with the tasks and games. First day had some innovative games and tasks from which only top 30 teams were selected for the Day 2 of Junkyard.
The next day, top teams gathered along with their innovative thinking, creative abilities and team co-ordination to create useful products from the scraps and junks provided to them. Based on what they made, the innovation behind it, all the concepts, workings of their model and their implementation in real world, our judges picked the Best three teams from which the first-place holder, Team Alpha won and got set to represent AKGEC at Zonal.

The sole intention behind starting off with a department society was to provide a channelized growth medium to the students, not merely in the field of academics, but also for other extra-curricular activities.
In 2006-07, the Society started by organising six major events in the Techfest held on 16th and 17th October 2006. The events organised for the first time were Bob the Builder, Gears to puzzle you, Robo Race, Junk Yard, Workshop Modelling and Paper Presentation. Robo Race and Junk Yard was amongst the most popular technical events in the history of college. In the subsequent years, new events like “The Sea Legacy" and “The Wrath of Wings" were added and few events were modified such as Robo Race is modified to Rob Soccer. Maintaining its trend of enhancing technical skills and sharpening young minds, SAMVEG kept its journey on by conducting atleast two events in every academic year independently such as Table Stable, Bridge it… Fix it, World without Engineering, Student of the Year, Roadsters, Boreas' Battle amongst others. Samveg students organized a college level conference **“Tomorrow’s India”** on 11 Oct 2015 under the guidance of Prof. I.P. Sharma, HoD, ME, and Mr. Pallab Biswas, Faculty Advisor –Samveg.
> Samveg Society Students on 27th September, 2014 under the guidance of Prof. I.P. Sharma, HoD, ME, and Mr. Pallab Biswas , Faculty Advisor -Samveg, organised **CoMEGT** – the Conference on Mechanical Engineering in Green Technologies. This was the **first ever students’ conference held in our college**. The motive of the conference was to promote green technology, which is the need of the hour as it drastically helps keep the environment greener by reducing carbon footprints. This conference was conducted zealously. The work was well organized and effectively distributed. The main objective was to inculcate the idea of green technology amongst college students by the medium of conference where they got an interactive platform for presenting their views on latest innovations in the field of green technology. Another objective of this conference was to develop a professional environment in our college which was successfully achieved by developing the presentation skills of a large number of students during the course of the event and also develop research acumen in them.
The event was concluded in following four phases:
  * Synopses submission and short listing
  * Seminar on techniques for giving good presentation


  * Mentorship program for finalists
  * Conference


The conference proved to be an interactive platform where all the participants, the judges and the audience participated in an integrated manner to promote and share the knowledge of green technology, **“a boon to the present era”**.

“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." – Aristotle
A cadre of dynamic individuals, possessing a diverse spectrum of aptitudes, and perspectives, constitutes Horizon. The organization aspires to cultivate the technical and managerial sagacity of students, equipping them to navigate perpetually.
The logo aptly expresses the goal of the society. The saffron area represents freedom of innovation, ideas, and intellect. The Steel Grey part represents determination, discipline, and dedication. When these two areas converge, any tough job becomes easier. The logo points towards both dimensions, hence HORIZON – exploring extremities and beyond.
### Vision

### Mission
We aim at creating technocrats, entrepreneurs & above all Innovative minds with impeccable grit, discretionary vision, and effective leadership.  
● Bridging the gap between technical and managerial skills.  
● Exposure of students to the wider community.  
● Establishing a process that is independent of individual competence.  
● Providing a common platform to students, irrespective of their backgrounds to initiate, innovate, and explore new ideas under expert guidance and effective mentorship.

# Renaissance
Introduction
The society, Renaissance was formed in 2008 by three determined students who wished to 'bring a change' around themselves by being the change with the motto “BE THE CHANGE YOU WISH TO SEE”
The society derived its name from the cultural & social movement of Europe called 'Renaissance' which means 'Rebirth'. And hence we work together towards the 'Awakening of Consciousness'.
Intellectual education influences the individual mind and values-based education influences the heart. True education is the training of both the head and the heart.
Renaissance – “Awakening of consciousness” is the Ethical cum Patriotic Society of college.
We, as the only ethical society of college have donated clothes to the needy in the winters. We have organized numerous seminar in the college in order to highlight the ongoing social issues.

# Verve
Verve Fashion Team
About Verve
V-Verve is the fashion society of our college. We are a society of like minded fashion enthusiasts who aim to help students find and develop their own unique style.
[ ![VERVE FASHION TEAM](https://www.akgec.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/verve.jpg) ](https://www.akgec.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/verve.jpg "VERVE FASHION TEAM")
We put up fashion shows based on various themes. When one hears the term “fashion show" one can't help but think of flawless models embellished with gorgeous dresses and makeup walking under the spotlight in their high heels. However, what most people fail to see is that underneath that makeup and costumes simmer hours of rehearsals and meticulous conceptualizing of the themes that are portrayed.
From designing the dresses and props to choreographing the show and preparing the soundtrack, we do it all, without any outside help and everything is done exclusively on the basis of the theme. And in the end, our models sizzle the ramp with their confidence and glamour.
Our shows are more than just a strut in stilettos. We do not talk, we do not act and yet our shows shout out to the audiences about social issues like Drug abuse, depression, women empowerment, LGBT etc.
V-Verve will appeal to anyone with an interest in fashion whether it be designing, modelling, photography or simply a love for creativity.

Since CSI student chapter has evolved in AKGEC, it has been one of the most active societies of the institute by organising events and workshops which have proven to be blockbusters in the college. The active image of the society becomes more prominent during the annual national level event, The Initiative, wherein the society asks students to provide solutions to the burning issues our country is facing. CSI AKGEC Chapter is known for its highly skilled team members, and the efficiency & quality of the events and workshops that it conducts. Recently Team CSI conducted Java and Android workshop, Ethical Hacking workshop which saw immense participation among the students! Another blockbuster event of CSI AKGEC chapter includes the online gaming event Route De Moksha which has always proven to be the best event conducted in the College tech fest. Though not being organised since a couple years, lets hope the famous RDM will make a return soon enough! The incredible efforts put in by the student members of the society always earn significant admiration.

# T&P Programmes
### PROGRAMMES FOR STUDENTS
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES (PDP)
Academic excellence alone is not enough and cannot guarantee a good career. Certain personality attributes and soft skills are essential not only to get a good job but also to be able to contribute and grow in an organization. Taking cognizance of this, the college emphasises all round development through a range of extracurricular activities as well as organizing and conducting formal Personality Development Program.
This programme spanning over 100 hours is conducted by a professional agency and includes training in communication skills, group discussion, interpersonal skills and interviews. This is a mandatory programme for second year B.Tech. and MCA students of the college. This programme helps in the overall personality development of students. The whole exercise is intended to increase the employability of students. Amidst an inspiring and invigorating environment, students undergo training that turns them into top notch professionals.
INFOSYS CAMPUS CONNECT PROGRAM
As a step towards grooming students into perfect professionals and to make them compatible with the IT industry, Infosys campus connect programme (Springboard) is run by T&P department which is conducted by Infosys. Under this programme, Infosys train some identified faculty on emerging courses under Faculty Enabled Program (FEP).  
In this program B. Tech III year CSE, IT students undergo training on emerging certification courses by Infosys on Springboard platform under the guidance of trained faculty.
These steps not only help Infosys to reduce their in-house training time but also help the students in acquiring technical skills which make them more suitable for IT industry.
**The entire educational process at AKGEC revolves around guiding and providing the students all the imperative and relevant inputs to take on the professional world with conviction and confidence. Thus apart from PDP & Infosys CCP (Springboard) our college also offers modules on ProE, CAT/A etc. leading to certification and helping students to become proficient in the current generation CAD software used in industry.**

Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College commenced publication of a biennial Technical Journal in 2010 to disseminate information spanning the entire spectrum of engineering and technology. We envisioned that this activity will help unleash the creative potential of technical community and provide a credible platform to receive professional recognition. Our journey through this arduous path has been a satisfying effort. We have sustained interest and support of the country’s Technical community.
The Journal aims to provide platform to researchers, academicians, developers, industry experts and authors interested in state-of-the art and state-of-the-practice activities via publishing their research-based papers, articles and case studies on topics of current concern in the areas of engineering branches, namely electrical engineering, electronics, communication technology, instrumentation and measurement, information technology, computers, mechanical engineering, robotics and allied disciplines.
Our source of articles mainly comprises the faculty teaching in Engineering Colleges across the country. Process of publication of the Journal is supervised by IIT-background professionals with impeccable credentials. The articles are blind-peer reviewed and published following internationally-accepted IEEE style as the format for publication. Printed on art paper, the Journal with ISSN number 0975-9514 is currently running in its Ninth volume. To begin with we had planned the Journal at the national level. Gradually, the contributions started coming from overseas Universities and we converted it to an international journal.
To recognize the invaluable Intellectual contribution made by professionals in advancing the noble cause of dissemination of scientific and engineering knowledge, all published articles since Volume 7 of the “AKGEC International Journal of Technology” are being suitably rewarded. A prize of Rs.5,000 is being paid to the paper adjudged the best for each issue. For the balance, an amount of Rs.2,500 per article is earmarked.

Dr. R.K. Agarwal has an exceptionally brilliant academic background with B.Tech from IIT Kanpur, M.S. from CIT, Cranfield, UK and PhD from IISc Bangalore. During his illustrious career of nearly three decades in the Indian Air Force and Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO), he has held various key appointments including Chief Engineering Officer of an Operational Base, Director (Engg) at Air HQ and Project Director at Centre for Airborne Systems. His vast managerial, administrative, research and academic experience includes teaching assignments at Air Force Technical College and nine years of pioneering R&D work on the prestigious AWACS project in DRDO. He has also been a member of the Aeronautical Research & Development Board (ARDB) panel for approval and review of sponsored research projects at various centres of Excellence established at IITs and CSIR Laboratories.
He is the recipient of the coveted Royal Aeronautical Society (UK) award for academic excellence at CIT and a citation with cash award by DRDO for his contribution to the design and development of Airborne Early Warning aircraft, culminating in its maiden flight.
After taking voluntary retirement in 2004, Dr. Agarwal decided to contribute in the field of technical education and has been the Director of Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College (AKGEC), Ghaziabad since then. He has been persistently working towards setting new benchmarks in academic excellence as well as industry–academia interface to make the students globally competitive and employable. During his tenure, the college has not only been consistently maintaining exceptional results and placements but has also made significant progress in research and industry relevant consultancy projects. A number of initiatives and collaborative ventures with eminent multi-national companies have lead to establishment of many multi-disciplinary, high technology industry relevant facilities. These include India’s first Kuka Industrial Robotics Training Centre, NI-LabVIEW Academy, Bosch Rexroth Centre of Competence in Automation Technologies, Janatics Industrial Pneumatic Knowledge Centre and Mitsubishi Electric India. The college has also achieved the unique distinction of receiving the Academic Excellence Award for Best Engineering College in UPTU for two successive years under his able guidance.
He has also contributed in bringing about a culture of corporate social responsibility in academic institutions. The social activities initiated by him include running a free primary school in the college, adopting a municipal corporation school in a nearby village, providing tuition fee subsidy to children of class IV employees, donating computers to spread computer literacy and generously contributing for relief work after natural calamities. Involvement in these activities makes the students conscious of their civic and social responsibilities. He places special emphasis on all round development with focus on inculcating self-discipline, good moral values, ethics, work culture and a positive attitude to make the students not just competent professionals but also good citizens and responsible members of the society.
His wide ranging experience, vision and dynamism have infused inspiration and provided a road map for academic institutions to achieve the zenith of excellence in all fields of activities.
Dr. R.K. Agarwal’s extraordinary inspiring-vision catapulted AKGEC to numero uno position for all time to come. He took the momentous decision in 2010 to launch this biannual publication to nurture creativity and encourage innovations. The journal received manuscripts even from overseas authors, earning accolades from research community worldwide.

During the Covid 19 pandemic, AKGEC FabLab developed a low cost yet environmental friendly and reusable products – Respirator and Face shield using 3D printing Technology. 
The respirator was developed using Polylactic Acid. The filter material used was disposable mask cloth but any material as per exposed environment can be used. Design considerations such as suitability for average male / female face size with ergonomic characteristics and perfect fit on the face without causing any problems due to prolonged usage were taken into consideration. The weight of the respirator was 47 grams and average cost of manufacture was INR 100.

The Science Centre showcased a whole world of wonder and amazement with a plethora of exhibits on Space Technology, Information and Communication Technology, Oceanography and Earth Sciences, Agricultural Technology, Material Science, Nanotechnology, Energy and Transportation Technology and many more.
The students gained useful knowledge from the various fun filled innovative activities and the exhibits.

# Innovations During Covid 19 Pandemic
During the Covid 19 pandemic, AKGEC FabLab developed a low cost yet environmental friendly and reusable products – Respirator and Face shield using 3D printing Technology.
The respirator was developed using Polylactic Acid. The filter material used was disposable mask cloth but any material as per exposed environment can be used. Design considerations such as suitability for average male / female face size with ergonomic characteristics and perfect fit on the face without causing any problems due to prolonged usage were taken into consideration. The weight of the respirator was 47 grams and average cost of manufacture was INR 100.
The face shield was developed using 3D printed visor, A4 transparent plastic sheet (175 microns thickness) and elastic (hair rubber band). The material used per shield was 8 grams industry grade PLA. The printing time was 32 minutes and the assembly time 2 minutes. The average cost of manufacturing of the shield was INR 90.

# Open Source Software R&D Center
In the present day scenario, the open source software is replacing the proprietary software because of manifold advantages they have over proprietary software. Even though Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) is widely used, much of the computer science research community has yet to fully recognise its potential to change the world of research and developement of software intensive systems across disciplines.
The establishment of this research and development centre is expected to create a unique opportunity to all stake holders of the institute. The facility so created shall be useful to carry out research/developement/training/consultancy related to open source software. The centre will customize the open source software according to the requirements. It will also train the students and facilities of our institute and will involve them in the developement and customisation of recent open source software.
