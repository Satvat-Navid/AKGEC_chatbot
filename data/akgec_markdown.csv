https://www.akgec.ac.in/academics/policy-and-process-for-refund-of-caution-money/, "# Policy and Process for Refund of Caution Money\nThe caution money and security deposit are refundable after deduction of dues, if any, only after the student finally leaves the College on completion of the course.\nEach student, studying in the final year of his/her course, is required to fill up clearance form (No Dues Form) and submit the same to the Accounts Office, before leaving the College. The Accounts Office processes the forms and distributes the cheques of caution money at the time of College Convocation. For this the students are individually informed through letters and e-mails. Majority of the caution money cheques are distributed in one go in a single day through the aforesaid process. Those students who fail to attend the Convocation Ceremony may collect their cheques on any other working day during College hours.\n  * 27th Km Milestone,Delhi-Meerut Expressway,P.O.

https://www.akgec.ac.in/life-akgec/events/college-events/alumni-meet/, "# Alumni Meet\n### \nThe 18th Alumni Meet 2025, organized by the Alumni Association of Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College on 5th April 2025 at the College Football Ground, was a heartwarming event filled with nostalgia, camaraderie, and joyful reunions. The gracious presence of Dr. R. K. Agarwal, Director General, added immense inspiration, as alumni expressed their gratitude for his unwavering support and guidance. Alumni from the 2003 and 2004 batches, as well as from AKGIM and AKGEC, participated enthusiastically, especially during the engaging open mic session. Fun-filled activities like Tambola and Musical Chairs brought an element of playfulness, while vibrant dance performances by Taal, soulful songs by Euphony, and a dazzling fashion show by Verve added to the festive atmosphere. The evening concluded with energetic dancing at the DJ night. Dr. Rahul Sharma, Head of the Department of IT and Dean, Idea Lab, extended heartfelt thanks to all attendees for their enthusiastic participation and continued support. The event was further graced by the presence of Heads of Departments, Deans, Section In-charges, and faculty members, who reconnected with alumni and shared cherished memories, contributing to the event’s grand success.\n### \nAKGEC has always recognized the significance of its alumni network, considering it as a valuable asset. Established in 2005, the AKGEC Alumni Association has consistently worked towards fostering enduring relationships with its alumni, aiming for mutual benefit and sustained engagement. AKGEC conducted its first alumni meet on 2 April 2005. Since then, the association's efforts have been instrumental in organizing various events and initiatives, including the annual alumni meet.\nThe 17th edition of the Alumni Meet, held on 30th March 2024, continued the tradition of bringing together alumni spanning across different batches from 2003 to 2023. With approximately 500 alumni in attendance along with their families, the event was a testament to the strong bonds formed within the AKGEC community.This meet commenced with a warm welcome extended to the alumni and their families. It was filled with motivational speeches, a panel discussion on 'How can AKGEC alumni support each other,' and enjoyable activities such as Tambola, a college-themed quiz, and musical chairs.\nEngaging in conversations, and reminiscing about fond memories, added a vibrant flair to the occasion. The event also featured energetic dance performances, melodious music, and a thrilling DJ event, adding to the festivities. Throughout the event, there were informal interactions between the alumni and key figures from the college, including the Director General, Heads of Departments, Section In-charges, and Faculty members. The conclusion of the meeting was marked by a Lucky Draw followed by a dinner shared amongst all attendees. Concluding the event, Dr Rahul Sharma, HOD-IT, and Dean Idea Lab extended sincere thanks to all attendees for their wholehearted participation and invaluable contributions, expressing deep gratitude for their support and involvement.\nAs the evening drew to a close, alumni departed with a renewed commitment to stay connected with the institute through various engagement activities, reaffirming their pledge to reconvene for the next Alumni Meet in 2025.\n### \nOne of the strengths of AKGEC is, and has always been, its alumni. To establish, maintain and nurture a sustained, lifelong, and mutually beneficial relationship with its alumni, AKGEC formed an Alumni Association in 2005.

Beyond its immediate impact on physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated psychological suffering and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, due to the pandemic-related restrictions and its after effects.\nThe message of Yoga in promoting both the physical and mental well-being of humanity has never been more relevant. A growing trend of people around the world embracing Yoga to stay healthy and rejuvenated and to fight social isolation and depression has been witnessed during the pandemic.

https://www.akgec.ac.in/life-akgec/social-responsibilities/eco-friendly-environment/, "# Eco Friendly Environment\nThe basic philosophy of AKGEC towards all processes and activities is oriented towards environmental sustenance and eco friendliness. The architecture, design and construction of college building is such that bricks and stones are used maximum and cement plastering is minimal which makes it maintenance free. The architecture of buildings ensures maximum sunlight on all floors. This allows high circulation of natural air and green plantations to flourish inside and outside buildings. The buildings are thermally insulated which keeps the temperature lower in summers and higher in winters, thereby reducing the need for power consumption.\nEach block and building is surrounded by large open areas on which green lawns, hedges and planters maintain a healthy balance with environment.\nA network of rain harvesting systems ensure continuous recharging of ground water table. The sewage treatment plant recycles the water filtered through its beds for use of horticulture, green lawns, hedges and plantations of college.\nThere is high focus on conservation of natural resources. Automatic water dispensers are used in toilets / urinals to avoid continuous running of water and ensure its usage when needed.\n> Conservation of electricity is ensured by its usage only when and where needed. Slowly a culture has been built amongst faculty and staff to put off appliances, lights and fans when they leave office. Conservation of electricity is also ensured by use of solar water heaters for providing hot water in all the 6 hostels of the college. A roof top solar power plant of 330 KW capacity has been installed in college campus. This power plant is linked with the electric grid of electricity department where surplus power generated is fed back through a meter installed for this purpose.\nConservation of fossil fuels is ensured by making special efforts to co-ordinate and club various trips of vehicles required by different departments and their usage optimised.\nThe waste management area is given high priority. The recyclable garbage waste and non recyclable wastes are dumped in specified containers / dustbins. A separate agency with specialised expertise and dealing in waste collection and disposal has been hired to collect the wastes on daily basis. This company processes the bi-degradable waste to make manure and dispose off cyclable & non-cyclable wastes as per established norms of Government.\n_**“Optimum usage of natural resources used by mankind is the basic need of the day to maintain required balance in natureThis theme is our mantra.""**_\n  * 27th Km Milestone,Delhi-Meerut Expressway,P.O.
